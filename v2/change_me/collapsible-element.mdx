# Collapsible Element 

You can expand / minimize content by using the below:

<details>
<summary>Default State</summary>
This is the default state of the `detail` component which uses font size 16px
</details>

<br />

<details><summary style={{
    fontSize: "20px"
}}>appName (compulsory)</summary>
This is the name of your application. It is used when sending password reset or email verification emails (in the default email design). An example of this is appName: "GitHub".
</details>

<br />

<details><summary style={{
    fontSize: "20px"
}}>websiteDomain (compulsory)</summary>

This is the domain part of your website on which the SuperTokens' will operate on. By operate, we mean that the login UI will be shown on this domain and / or the session information will be stored under this domain. For example:

- For local development, you are likely using localhost with some port (ex 8080). Then the value of this should be `"http://localhost:8080"`.
- If your website is `https://www.example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://www.example.com"`.
- If your website is `https://example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://example.com"`.
- If you have multiple sub domains, and your users login via `https://auth.example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://auth.example.com"`.

By default, the login UI will be displayed on `{websiteDomain}/auth/*` (See about websiteBasePath to change the `/auth/*` part).

We need the domain information on the frontend for routing purposes, and on the backend so that we can generate correct email verification and password reset links.
