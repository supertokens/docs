# Introduction

SuperTokens provides User Roles feature which allows you to:
- Create roles and associate them with an array of permissions.
- Associate an array of roles to each user.
- Fetch a list of roles and permissions for a user.
- Save the roles and permissions in a session to access them effeciently on the frontend and backend APIs.
- Guard frontend routes and backend APIs to only allow access if a user has a certain role or permission.

When using this recipe the general flow would be as follows:
1. Create a role and assign permissions to that role
2. Assign roles to users
3. Protect your API and website routes by verifying that the user has the correct role and permissions

<CustomAdmonition type="multi-tenancy">

In a multi tenant setup, roles and permissions are shared across all tenants, however, the mapping of users to roles are on a per tenant level.

For example, if you create one role (`"admin"`) and add permissions to it for `read:all` and `write:all`, this role can be reused across all tenants. So, if you have user ID `user1` that has access to `tenant1` and `tenant2`, you can give them the `admin` role in `tenant1`, but not in `tenant2` (which can have a different set of roles for this user).
