## Config values

### `palette`
- The palette allows you to customize basic colours of our forms.
- Read the [common customizations guide](/docs/thirdparty/common-customizations/styling/changing-colours) for more information about the palette.

### `useShadowDom`
- Styling encapsulation relies on [shadow DOM browser feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM). 
- Default: `true`

:::caution
- SuperTokens uses only randomized styles to define its styling so disabling shadow DOM  should not impact the rest of your application's styles. On the other hand, when disabling Shadow DOM, make sure to verify that your CSS does not impact how SuperTokens UI is rendered.
- Shadow DOM will always be disabled with Internet Explorer since it does not support it. Similarly, if you intend to support Internet Explorer for your application make sure to verify how SuperTokens UI is rendered.
