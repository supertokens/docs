### `formFields` 
- An array that let's you overwrite the default email/password fields labels, placeholder and validation methods, as well as defining new fields.
- Example: 
    ```tsx
    formFields: [{
        id: "age",
        label: "Your age",
        placeholder: "How old are you?",
        validate: async (value) => {
            // Custom validation
        }
    },{
        id: "name",
        label: "Full name",
        placeholder: "First name followed by last name"
        optional: true
    }]
    ```
- Fields:
    - `id`
        - Unique ID of the form field. For the email and password fields, the value is `"email"` and `"password"` respectively.
        - Type: `string`
    - `label`
        - Label that will be displayed in the sign up form above the input field.
        - Type: `string`
    - `placeholder`
        - Placeholder that will be displayed in the sign up inputs before the user types in.
        - Type: `string`
        - Default: Equal to corresponding label.
    - `validate`
        - If your field requires a front end validation, you can define a `validate` method that will be called when the user clicks on the Sign up button. Please refer to the [common customizations guide](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/common-customizations/signup-form/field-validators) for an example of how to use `validate` methods.
        - Function input:
            - value: `any`
        - Function output:
            - Promise:
                - `string`: Return an error string when validation fails.
                - `undefined`: Return `undefined` when there are no errors.
    - `optional`
        - Set to `true` if you want to make the field optional. 
        - Type: `boolean`
        - Default: `false`
