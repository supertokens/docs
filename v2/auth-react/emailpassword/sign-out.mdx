## `signOut()`


The `signOut` method simply revokes the session for the user on the frontend and backend.

```tsx
import { signOut } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";

await signOut();
```

:::caution
This function does not redirect the user to the login screen. You will need to do that yourself post `awaiting` it.
