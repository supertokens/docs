# How to send a custom response

:::important
This feature is only applicable for users who build their own frontend since our frontend requires on a specific output from the APIs as defined [here](https://supertokens.com/docs/fdi).
:::

To see how this works, you can have a look at [these docs](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/advanced-customizations/apis-override/custom-response/api-override). This link shows how to override and send a custom response for an API that exists in the `thirdpartyemailpassword` API. You can follow the same method and send custom responses from any of the APIs exposed by this recipe.
