# Lambda Authorizer

A Lambda Authorizer configured like in the [Authorizer guide](./authorizer) can help integrate Supertokens with an AppSync service.  

## 1) Set up the AppSync service

Set up the AppSync service with an API key authorization. For more details, please see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/quickstart.html).

## 2) Configure the API Gateway with the authorizer

Follow the [Authorizer guide](./authorizer) to set up the API Gateway with the `/auth`, and `/graphql` resources set up. As the guide shows, `/auth` should be pointed to a lambda that handles the auth APIs as shown [here](./auth-serverless).


When setting up the POST method on `/graphql`, you should use the following settings:
- Integration type: AWS service
- AWS Region: the region of the AppSync service
- AWS Service: AppSync Data Plane
- AWS Subdomain: the part of the domain of the GraphQL service before `.appsync-api.`
- HTTP method: POST
- Action type: Use path override
- Path override: `/graphql`
- Execution role: the ARN of an execution role that is authorized to call the AppSync service (e.g.: `AWSAppSyncInvokeFullAccess`)

## 3) Set up the integration headers

Configure the "Integration Request" of the `/graphql` POST method.

- Add `HTTP Header` mappings:
    - "x-api-key": The API key of the App Sync service, wrapped in single quotes.
    - "x-user-id": `context.authorizer.principalId`, without quotes.

## 4) Consume the context in resolvers

You can access the headers you mapped above in resolvers through the context. (e.g., $context.request.headers.custom) For more information, please see the [resolver context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-context-reference.html) docs.
