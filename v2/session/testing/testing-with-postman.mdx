# Testing with Postman


The following guide will go over the process of testing backend APIs with Postman. These APIs are automatically exposed via our backend SDK (`/auth/*` path).

:::important
- Make sure that the Session Recipe is correctly setup in your backend 
- For the examples given below we will be running our backend on domain `localhost` and port `3001`
- The Open API spec for the APIs being tested can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/supertokens/FDI).
- Postman does cookie management on its own. So you don't need to manually set cookies on each request.
:::

## 1. Create a new Session
We will first test creating a new session and check that session tokens are set.
- For example, in your backend API you can use the `Session.createNewSession` function and check that the session tokens are set in the response through Postman.

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```jsx
// in you backend
app.post("/create-new-session", async (req, res) => {
    await Session.createNewSession(res, "test-user", {}, {})
    res.send({
        "message": "New user session created"
    })
})

```
</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/create-new-session`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `session`.

- On a successful request, a new user session will be created, with session tokens being returned in the response.

You can see the session tokens set by the response by switching to the cookies tab

These cookies are:
- `sIdRefreshToken`
- `sAccessToken`
- `sRefreshToken`

More information about these cookies can be found [here](../common-customizations/sessions/cookie-consent)


## 2. Session Verification

- We can also test APIs that require the user to be logged in.

- For example, we have an API used to query user data with the `verifySession` middleware as shown below.

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```jsx
// The following code snippet is an example API. You do not need to 
// implement it in your app

app.post("/change-user-data", Session.verifySession(), async (req, res) => {
    let userId = req.session.getUserId();
      // mutate some user data
    res.send({
        userId
    })
})
```
</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/change-user-data`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `session`.
- If you have the `antiCsrf` attribute set to `VIA_TOKEN` in your backend SuperTokens config, then, in the Postman Header tab, set the key as `anti-csrf` and value as the `anti-csrf` token retrieved from the login response.
- On a successful response, the response body will contain user data.

:::important
By default, for `GET` APIs, you don't need to provide the `anti-csrf` request header as anti-CSRF checks are only done in non-`GET` APIs
:::

In case you query the `/change-user-data` API with an expired access token, you will get a `401` response with the message `try refresh token`. 

<img width="600px" src="/img/emailpassword/st-user-unauthorized.png" />

To generate new session tokens you can use the `/auth/session/refresh` API as shown in the next section.


## 3. Refreshing Session Tokens
In case your `access token` expires you can call the `/auth/session/refresh` api to generate a new `access token` and `refresh token`.
- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/auth/session/refresh`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `session`.
- On a successful response, new session tokens will be set

<img width="600px" src="/img/emailpassword/st-ep-refresh.png" />

You can see the new session tokens by switching to the cookies tab

<img width="600px" src="/img/emailpassword/st-ep-refresh-cookies.png" />


## 4. Logout
The `/auth/signout` API will be used to invalidate the  user sessions. This will clear the session cookies set in postman.
- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/auth/signout`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `session`.
- On a successful response, the session tokens will be cleared from Postman, and from the database
