# Authentication without JWTs

:::tip Coming Soon
:::

To support SuperTokens auth with Hasura without using JWTs you would need to:
- Set up a reverse proxy in your backend server that would relay requests from your frontend to Hasura
- Your frontend would call an API on your backend, the API would then use [verifySession](../common-customizations/sessions/session-verification-in-api/verify-session) and add userId and other claims to each request made to Hasura

:::info
The advantage of using this mechanism is that no token is exposed to the frontend, which prevents XSS attacks
