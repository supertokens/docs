# Getting public keys for JWT verification

:::caution
Using JWTs is optional and is only required if you want to integrate with another service that relies on JWTs or if you want to integrate with a backend framework that we do not support yet
:::

## 1) Call the JWKS endpoint for SuperTokens Core

SuperTokens uses RSA for signing JWTs, this means that in order to verify the JWT you need a public key. SuperTokens provides a JWKS endpoint that contains a set of public keys as Json Web Keys

You can make a `GET` request to the SuperTokens core on `{connectionURI}/recipe/jwt/jwks`:
- If you are using our managed service use the `connectionURI` found on the supertokens.com dashboard
- If you are using the self-hosted option, you can query any one of the SuperTokens core instances that you host

:::important
When calling `{connectionURI}/recipe/jwt/jwks`, if you get back a `401` response, it means that you have not supplied the right API key for the core. You can pass the API key using the `api-key` header in the request.
:::

The response would be similar to: 

```json
{
    "keys": [
        {
            "kty": "RSA",
            "kid": "2de612a5-a5ba-413e-9216-4c43e2e78c86",
            "n": "AMZruthvYz7Ft-Dp0BC_...", // Truncated for display
            "e": "AQAB",
            "alg": "RS256",
            "use": "sig"
        }
    ],
    "status": "OK"
}
```

The `keys` array in the response contains a list of Json Web Keys (JWK).

## 2) JWT verification using a key string

A JWK can also be converted into a key string. Some libraries and services may require you to provide a key string during JWT verification.

For example, let's consider using NodeJS with `jsonwebtoken`. `jsonwebtoken` allows you to provide a certificate that will be used to verify JWTs, once you fetch a JWK to use (as explained above) you can then convert it to a key string by using a library or an online service (since this is a public key there is no risk in using an online service).

In this example we will use `jwk-to-pem`

```tsx
import jwkToPem from 'jwk-to-pem';

// This JWK is copied from the result of the above SuperTokens core request
let jwk = {
    "kty": "RSA",
    "kid": "2de612a5-a5ba-413e-9216-4c43e2e78c86",
    "n": "AMZruthvYz7Ft-Dp0BC_SEEJaWK91s_YA-RR81iLJ6BTT6gJp0CcV4DfBynFU_59dRGOZyVQpAW6Drnc_6LyZpVWHROzqt-Fjh8TAqodayhPJVuZt25eQiYrqcaK_dnuHrm8qwUq-hko6q1o1o9NIIZWNfUBEVWmNhyAJFk5bi3pLwtKPYrUQzVLcTdDUe4SIltvvfpYHbVFnYtxkBVmqO68j7sI8ktmTXM_heals-W6WmozabDkC9_ITCeRat2f7A2l0t4QzO0ZCzZcJfhusF4X1niKgY6yYXpbX6is4HCfhYfdabcE52xYMNl-gw9XDjsIxfBMUDvOFRHWlx0rU8c=",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "use": "sig"
};

// @ts-ignore
let certString = jwkToPem(jwk);
```

The above snippet would generate the following certificate string:

```text
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxmu62G9jPsW34OnQEL9I
QQlpYr3Wz9gD5FHzWIsnoFNPqAmnQJxXgN8HKcVT/n11EY5nJVCkBboOudz/ovJm

XhfWeIqBjrJheltfqKzgcJ+Fh91ptwTnbFgw2X6DD1cOOwjF8ExQO84VEdaXHStT
xwIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

You can then use this when configuring `jsonwebtoken`

```ts
import JsonWebToken from 'jsonwebtoken';

// Truncated for display
let certificate = "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhki...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----";
let jwt = "...";
JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, certificate, function (err, decoded) {
    let decodedJWT = decoded;
    // Use JWT
});
```

For other languages, [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/libraries) recommends some libraries that you can use for JWT verification

:::caution
Make sure that you add line break characters to your string as shown above, certificate strings without the line breaks are considered invalid
