# Same site cookies

## About the `sameSite` cookie flag.

To ensure session cookies are protected from [CSRF attacks](./anti-csrf#csrf-attack) the ``sameSite`` cookie attribute is set.

The ``sameSite`` cookie attribute is used to declare if your cookies should be restricted to a first-party or same-site context.
The ``sameSite`` attribute can be set to three possible values:
- ``none``
  - Cookies will be sent in all contexts, i.e cookies will be attached to both first-party and cross-origin requests.
  - On Safari however, if third party cookies are blocked (which is the default behaviour), and the website and api domains do not share the same top level domain, then cookies won't go. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/issues/280) to know about workarounds - one of the workarounds is also described [here](../../advanced-customizations/examples/localstorage/about).
- ``lax``
  - Cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and along with `GET` requests initiated by third party websites (that result in browser navigation - user clicking on a link).
- ``strict``
  - Cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites.

## Manually set ``sameSite`` value

:::caution
- SuperTokens will automatically set the value of the ``sameSite`` cookie attribute based on your website and api domain configration.
- Please only change this setting if you are a web security expert. If you are unsure, please feel free to [ask questions to us](https://supertokens.io/discord).
