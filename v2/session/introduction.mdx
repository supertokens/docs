# Session management with SuperTokens

## Features

- Session management (access token + rotating refresh tokens) <br/>
- Read / Add / Edit user roles in your APIs and the frontend <br/>
- Protect website routes that need authentication <br/>
- Sign out feature <br/>
- Ban / Unban users and revoke sessions <br/>

## Security benefits

SuperTokens provides a secure way of handling token based authentication post login. We prevent many session related attack vectors:

- XSS (by using `httpOnly` cookies)
- Minimises damage from access token signing key compromise by automatically changing the keys.
- Minimises damage from session data theft from database, by only storing hashed tokens.
- Reliable detecting of session hijacking using rotating refresh tokens.
- CSRF attacks
- Brute force attacks
- Session fixation

:::caution
Depending on your application setup, sessions with cookies may not work on certain browsers like Safari which disable cross domain cookies by default.

To know if this is going to be a problem for you, please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/issues/280) (which also contains proposed solutions).

You can also find one of the solutions [here](./advanced-customizations/examples/localstorage/about).

## Overview of session flow

<img alt="Flowcharts showing an overview of session flow" src="/img/session_flow.png" />

- After sign in, a new session is created by issuing a refresh and access token to the frontend.
- The frontend sends the access token for each API call that requires session authentication.
- These API calls verify the access token and its expiry. If verification fails, the API throws a session expired error, else, execution continues.
- If an API throws session expired error, the frontend uses its refresh token to get a new refresh and a new access token. This is done via a special API on your backend. If a session has been revoked, this API will also throw session expired after which the user will have to login again.
- After obtaining a new set of tokens, the frontend retries the original API call, yielding the desired result.
- To revoke a session, the backend removes the refresh token and its session information from its database.


## Supported tech stacks
