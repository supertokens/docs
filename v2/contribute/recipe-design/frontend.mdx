# Frontend SDK
- 1) Should be as decoupled from other recipes as possible so that it can be reused.
- 2) Should be as minimal as possible.
- 3) All sub recipes being used should be allowed to be overrided by an instance provided in the constructor. This will allow super recipes to also use these sub recipes without creating multiple instances of those sub recipes. An example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/lib/ts/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword/recipe.tsx#L61).
- 4) All components and styles in the recipe should be overridable
    - a) All `divs` etc that are styled, should have a `data-supertokens` and a `css` prop like so `<div data-supertokens="container" css={styles.container}>`.
- 5) Each component theme should have a globally unique name. The format should be {actualRecipeId}{Name of component}. For example `ThirdPartyEmailPasswordSignInButton`
- 6) Each theme component must be overridable (using the `withOverride` component).
- 7) When doing output parsing for an API call, only handle what we care about. If the user has manually added some other fields to response from the API, let them handle that.
- 8) There should be one file where all the functions exposed by this recipe are listed and documented. This file will be linked from the docs as API documentation.
   - a) For functions
   - b) For component override interface
   - c) For functions override interface
- 9) User interaction with a recipe should be isolated to that recipe, even if that recipe uses several other sub recipes. For example, if a user initialises recipeX (which uses recipeY and recipeZ underneath), the user should not have to do `recipeY.something` or `recipeZ.something`. Therefore, recipeX must re-export useful functions / components that are provided by recipeY and recipeZ.
- 10) When implementing Recipe interfaces, make sure that if a function uses another function in the interface, it will call the user's overrided verion of that function (if the user has overriden it). See https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/199

## Recipe Interface Functions

### Error Handling

- a) If a function has valid error states, those should be returned from the function like `{status: "OK", ...} | {status: "ERROR_1", ...} | {status: "ERROR_2", ...}`. That is, no throwing or errors unless it's a `GENERAL_ERROR`, or if the type system for that language allows you to clearly define error types (like in the case of Java).
- b) `GENERAL_ERRORS` should be thrown as a normal error (depending on the language)

For example

```ts
function doSomething(status: "OK" | "ERROR") {
    let response = makeAPICall();

    if (response.status === "GENERAL_ERROR") {
        throw new Error(response.message);
    }

    ...

    return {status: response.status};
}
```

### Network Calls

- a) The recipe implementation should allow for pre-api hooks to be configured when the recipe is initialised. These hooks should be called by implementation functions before making any network request.
- b) Each recipe interface function should allow for a "local" pre-api hook, this can be useful where users require dynamic request parameters or if for specific APIs the fields in the recipe level pre-api hook need to be changed.
- c) Each recipe implementation should allow for post-api hooks to be configured when the recipe is initialised. These hooks should be called by the functions after network requests have completed.

Recipe Level Pre + Post API Hook (Javascript example)

```ts
Recipe.init({
    preApiHook: (req: RequestInit) => Promise<RequestInit>,
    // Read the Custom function responses section to understand what jsonBody and fetchResponse are
    postApiHook: (req: RequestInit, url: string, jsonBody: any, fetchResponse: Response) => Promise<void>,
})
```

For function level pre API hooks we introduce a new `options` parameter.

```ts
function doSomething(options?: {
    preApiHook?: (req: RequestInit) => RequestInit,
}) {
    ...
    let requestConfig: RequestInit = {...}
    requestConfig = callRecipePreAPIHook(requestConfig);
    
    if (options !== undefined && options.preApiHook !== undefined) {
        requestConfig = options.preApiHook(requestConfig);
    }

    makeAPIRequest(requestConfig);
    ...
}
```

:::important
In recipe functions the API logic should follow this order:

1. Create a request object (For example RequestInit in JS).
2. Call the recipe level pre api hook.
3. Call the function level pre api hook.
4. Call the API
:::

### Function return types

Each recipe interface function must follow a consistent return scheme:

{
    status: "OK" | "...",
    jsonBody: any,
    fetchResponse: Response,
    ...
}

Functions that call APIs must always return fetchResponse, this means that parameter validations need to change accordingly. For example consider the following function

```ts

function verifyEmail(token?: string) {
    // Read token from query params if undefined
}
```

Normally you would return a validation error if no `token` was provided and one couldnt be found in the query param. But this makes the return type inconsistent because in that case no API call was made and both `jsonBody` and `fetchResponse` would need to be marked as optional (making the overall API hard to consume)

Instead we set the value of `token` to something default (empty string for example) and let the API throw an error. This means that either the function will always have an API response to return or it will throw an error.

**Wrong &#10060**
```ts
function verifyEmail(token?: string) {
    if (token === undefined) {
        token = readFromQueryParams();
    }

    if (token === undefined) {
        return {status: "INVALID_TOKEN", ...}
    }

    callAPI(token);
}
```

**Correct &#9989**
```ts
function verifyEmail(token?: string) {
    if (token === undefined) {
        token = readFromQueryParams();
    }

    if (token === undefined) {
        token = "";
    }

    // This will throw an error
    callAPI(token);
}
```

### Custom function responses

Because the user can override APIs in the Backend SDK and provide responses in their own formats, the recipe functions on the Frontend must always assume that API responses (and function responses) can be non-standard. The recipe functions should rely on `status` in the API responses to decide if the response is a custom one.

For example consider a function `getUserInformation` that returns `{status: "OK" | "NOT_AUTHORISED"}`

```ts
async function getUserInformation(): Promise<{status: "OK" | "NOT_AUTHORISED"}> {}
```

If the user wants to return the userID from this function, they cannot do so by simply overriding the function. To accodmate this we return the json body and the response object back to the user from every recipe function. For the above example the signature of the method would then be

```ts
async function getUserInformation(): Promise<{status: "OK" | "NOT_AUTHORISED", jsonBody: any, fetchResponse: Response}> {}
```

The `jsonBody` allows the user to consume custom properties from the response body should they need it, the `fetchResponse` allows users to consume other properties such as headers from the API response.

:::important
Even though we support custom responses, users **MUST ALWAYS** provide the properties mentioned in the FDI in API responses. For example lets consider the `/user/email/verify GET` API which returns 

```ts
{
    "status": "OK",
    "isVerified": boolean,
}
```

Should the user want to provide a custom response they **HAVE TO** provide `isVerified`.

**Valid Response &#9989**
```ts
{
    "status": "OK",
    "isVerified": boolean,
    "userId": string,
}
```

**Invalid Response &#10060**
```ts
{
    "status": "OK",
    "userId": string,
}
```
