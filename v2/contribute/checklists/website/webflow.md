## Managing Webflow files
- Keep one main file where each project is added as a separate page.
- Have another project which is the currently working page
- For homepage and pricing page, having separate projects is fine
- For a new page on website remove the existing page in currently working page and put it inside the main file as another page.
- Now you can work on the new page in this project so you avoid creating multiple projects
