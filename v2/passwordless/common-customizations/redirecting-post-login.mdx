# Redirect the user to a specific route post login

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

By default, the user is redirected the the `/` route on your website post login. To change this, you can use the `getRedirectionURL` function on the frontend as shown below:

```tsx
SuperTokens.init({
    recipeList: [
        ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}.init({
            // highlight-start
            getRedirectionURL: async (context) => {
                if (context.action === "SUCCESS") {
                    if (context.redirectToPath !== undefined) {
                        // we are navigating back to where the user was before they authenticated
                        return context.redirectToPath;
                    }
                    return "/dashboard";
                }
                return undefined;
            }
            // highlight-end
        }),
    ]
});
```

The user will be redirected to the provided URL on:
- Successful sign up
- Successful sign in
- Successful email verification.
- If the user is already logged in.
