# Multitenant login

Multitenant login is a feature that lets you customize the login experience for each of your customers. For example, a customer `customer1` hosted on `customer1.yourdomain.com` can have login with email password (using this recipe), and another customer `customer2` hosted on `customer2.yourdomain.com` can have login with `Active Directory` and `Facebook` (using the thirdparty recipe).

## Features

### Unique login methods per tenant
Each tenant can have its own login method. For example, one tenant can have passwordless login, while another can have SSO login.

### Different user pools
Each tenant will have its own user pool.
- Isolating users to their orgnisation becomes very simple.
- This also means that one user can login using the same email across different tenants and they will be treated as different users. You can also share a user across tenants.

### Data isolation
In addition to the above, this feature can also be used to [implement data isolation for each of your tenants](./new-tenant-config#providing-additional-configuration-per-tenant) wherein a different database is used per tenant.

### Dynamic tenant creation
You can create and configure a tenant via few, simple API calls from your backend API layer. No need to manually onboard customers anymore.

### Multiple dev environments
Create multiple dev / staging environments to help with your development process. You can also create a new environment on the fly for CICD testing purposes.

### Flexible tenant discovery
Use any form of tenant discovery method. For example, use one sub domain per tenant, or a form for tenant selection. The form can have a list of tenants to choose from, or an input box to enter the tenantId / workspace URL / identifier - as defined by you.

## Types of UX flows

In this section, we will explore how to implement different forms of multi tenant login experiences:
- **Tenants use a common domain to login**: All tenants login using the same page (for example, `example.com/auth`) and are optionally redirected to their sub domain post login. At the start of the login flow, the customer will have to input their tenantId / workspace URL / identifier - as defined by you, and the login methods shown would be based on their tenantId.
- **Tenants use their sub domain to login**: Here, each tenant has a sub domain assigned to them (for example `customer1.example.com`, `customer2.example.com`, ...), and they would visit their sub domain to login and access their app. Each sub domain's login experience may be different (as defined by you or the tenant).

SuperTokens is flexible enough to allow other forms of UX as well, but since the above two flow are most common, we provide dedicated docs for them.
