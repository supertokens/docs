# Disable use of shadow DOM

We use [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to prevent CSS clashes between your CSS and the ones we provide. This guarantees that all our UI will render as expected.

However, this means that you cannot override our CSS using your CSS (though you can [use JS to do that](./changing-style)).

If you want to disable use of shadow dom, you can do so like:

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        Passwordless.init({
            // highlight-next-line
            useShadowDom: false
        }),
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

:::caution
If disabled, please be sure to check that our components render correctly - because your CSS might affect our components' UI (the other way around won't happen).
