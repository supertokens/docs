# Next Steps

## Setting Up the Core and Database

<Question
    question={() => {
        return (
            <span>Are you using <code>https://try.supertokens.com</code> as the connection URI in the init function?</span>
        )
    }}>
<Answer title="Yes">

You must now set up an instance of the SuperTokens core for your app that your backend should connect to. You have two options:

- [Managed service](../quick-setup/core/saas-setup)
- Self hosted with your own database ([With Docker](../quick-setup/core/with-docker) or [Without Docker](../quick-setup/core/without-docker))

<Answer title="No">
