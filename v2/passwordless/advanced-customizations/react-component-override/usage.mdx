# How to use

1. You will need to modify the `Passwordless.init(...)` function call.
2. Component overrides can be configured at `override.components` config object.
3. [Pick a component](#finding-which-component-will-be-overridden) that you'd like to override by its key.
4. Supply a React component against the key you have picked. Your custom component will get the original component as a `prop`.

## Example
<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";

// @ts-ignore
import octocat from "./octocat.png";

 Passwordless.init({
    contactMethod: "EMAIL", // This example will work with any contactMethod.
    override: {
        components: {
            PasswordlessSignInUpHeader: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                /**
                * In this case, the <PasswordlessSignInUpHeader> will render the default component
                * wrapped in div with octocat picture above it.
                */
                return (
                    <div>
                        <img src={octocat} />
                        <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                    </div>
                );
            }
        }
    }
});
```

<img src="/img/passwordless/react-override-octocat.png" style={{
    height: "500px"
}} />

:::important
Please make sure that the file in which this config is specified is a `.tsx` or ` .jsx` file type.

</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## Finding which component will be overridden
To do that, you should use React Developer Tools extension which provides a component tree inspector.

### Example
<img src="/img/passwordless/override/find-component.png" />

1. Look for the names defined in component override config
2. Ensure that's the component you want to override
3. Overide the component as stated above.

## How do I render the original component
Because the override function receives the original component as a parameter,
you can render it. To do this, simply use it in JSX. Don't forget to supply original props
by spreading them.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";

// @ts-ignore
import octocat from "./octocat.png";

 Passwordless.init({
    contactMethod: "EMAIL", // This example will work with any contactMethod.
    override: {
        components: {
            PasswordlessSignInUpHeader: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                return (
                    <>
                        <h1>I'm a header that you added above original component</h1>
                        <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                    </>
                )
            }
        }
    }
});
```
