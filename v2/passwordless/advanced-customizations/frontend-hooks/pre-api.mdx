# Pre API Hook

This function is called before any API call is being made to your backend from our frontend SDK. You can use this to change the request body / url / header or any other request property.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
Passwordless.init({
    contactMethod: "EMAIL",
    preAPIHook: async (context) => {
        let url = context.url;

        // is the fetch config object that contains the header, body etc..
        let requestInit = context.requestInit;

        let action = context.action;
        if (action === "EMAIL_EXISTS") {

        } else if (action === "PASSWORDLESS_CONSUME_CODE") {

        } else if (action === "PASSWORDLESS_CREATE_CODE") {

        } else if (action === "PASSWORDLESS_RESEND_CODE") {

        } else if (action === "PHONE_NUMBER_EXISTS") {

        }

        // events such as sign out are in the 
        // session recipe pre API hook (See the info box below)
        return {
            requestInit, url
        };
    }
})
```

:::info
Also checkout the [session recipe pre API hook](/docs/session/advanced-customizations/frontend-hooks/pre-api) for events such as sign out. These will need to go in the `Session.init` config object.
