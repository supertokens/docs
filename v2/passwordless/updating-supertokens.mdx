# Updating SuperTokens core and SDKs

:::important
You need to follow these steps in order to properly update supertokens
:::

In order to maintain compatibility and keep up on new features, we recommend updating your core and SDKs whenever possible.

## 1. Updating your core

You will need to shut down your core in order to update it. After it's off, run the migration scripts for all versions inbetween
your starting version and the latest version. You may then bring your core back online.

In the rare occasion that the supertokens core version you have updated to shows as incompatible with your current front-end and
back-end sdk's in the [compatibility table](./compatibility-table), then refrain from running your back-end and front-end SDKs until after you update them.

- ### Self-hosted core
See the migration sections in the [supertokens-core changelog](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

- ### Managed core
If you're using the managed core service, please email us at team@supertokens.com from your registered email to request a core update.
