# Reading the JWT Payload

### The ```getJWTPayloadSecurely``` function

<NpmOrScriptTabs>
<TabItem value="npm">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from 'supertokens-website';

let payload = await SuperTokens.getJWTPayloadSecurely();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="script">

```jsx
let payload = await supertokens.getJWTPayloadSecurely();
```

</TabItem>
</NpmOrScriptTabs>

Returns a ```Promise<JSON object>``` or throws an error in case reading failed.

:::tip Security
- This does not read from the access token, since that is in `httpOnly` cookie. Instead, it reads from another token that contains a copy of the payload in the access token.
- This is not a security issue since the access token payload by itself is not enough to grant access to an API.
