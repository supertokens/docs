# 1) Recipe init

<Disclaimer />

To start, we want to initialise the [ThirdPartyEmailPassword](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/quick-setup/frontend) and the [Passwordless](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/quick-setup/frontend) recipes as mentioned in their quick setup section:

<AppInfoForm
    askForAppName
    askForAPIDomain
    askForWebsiteDomain
>

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword, {Github, Google, Facebook, Apple} from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        appName: "^{form_appName}",
        apiDomain: "^{form_apiDomain}",
        websiteDomain: "^{form_websiteDomain}",
        apiBasePath: "^{form_apiBasePath}",
        websiteBasePath: "^{form_websiteBasePath}"
    },
    recipeList: [
        // first factor method
        ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
            signInAndUpFeature: {
                providers: [
                    Github.init(),
                    Google.init(),
                    Facebook.init(),
                    Apple.init(),
                ]
            }
        }),
        // second factor method
        Passwordless.init({
            contactMethod: "PHONE"
        }),
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```

</AppInfoForm>

In the subsequent sections, we will be seeing how to modify theses `init` calls so that we can achieve the flow we want. On a high level, we will be:
- Rendering the Passwordless login UI on a custom path.
- Auto skipping the screen which asks the user to input their phone number if we already have it - post sign in.
- Implementing a logout button on the second factor pre built UI screen.

:::important
In the guide, we will assume that the first factor path is `/auth`, and the second factor path is `/second-factor`.
