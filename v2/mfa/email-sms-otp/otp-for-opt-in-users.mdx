# OTP for specific users

In this page, we will show you how to implement an MFA policy that requires certain users to do the OTP challenge via email or sms. You can decide which those users are based on any criteria. For example:
- Only users that have an `admin` role require to do OTP; OR
- Only users that have enabled OTP on their account require to do OTP; OR
- Only users that have a paid account require to do OTP.

Whatever the criteria is, the steps to implementing this type of a flow is the same.

:::note
We assume that the first factor is [email password or social login](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/introduction), but the same set of steps will be applicable for other first factor types as well.

## Single tenant setup

- We simply initialise the multi factor auth recipe here without any override to `getMFARequirementsForAuth`. The default implementation of this function already checks what factors are enabled for a user and returns those. So all we need to do is mark `otp-email` as enabled for a user as soon as they have completed the OTP challenge successfuly. This happens in the `consumeCodePOST` API override as shown above. Once the code is consumed successfully, we mark the `otp-email` factor as enabled for the user, and the next time they login, they will be asked to complete the OTP challenge.
- Notice that before we call `addToRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser`, we check if there is an input session or not. We only want to call `addToRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser` function if there is a session which indicates that the user has finished some first factor already.

</details>

In both of the examples above, notice that we have initialised the Passwordless recipe in the `recipeList`. In this example, we only want to enable email based OTP, so we set the `contactMethod` to `EMAIL` and `flowType` to `USER_INPUT_CODE` (i.e. otp). If instead, you want to use phone sms based OTP, you should set the contact method to `PHONE`. If you want to give users both the options, or for some users use email, and for others use phone, you should set `contactMethod` to `EMAIL_OR_PHONE`.

We have also enabled the account linking feature since [it's required for MFA to work](../important-concepts#relation-of-account-linking-and-mfa). The above enables account linking for first and second factor login, but if you only want to enable it for second factor, see [this section](../backend-setup#enabling-account-linking-only-for-mfa-purposes).

Once the user finishes the first factor (for example, with emailpassword), their session access token payload will look like this (for those that require OTP):
```json
{
    "st-mfa": {
        "c": {
            "emailpassword": 1702877939,
        },
        "v": false
    }
}
```

The `v` being `false` indicates that there are still factors that are pending. After the user has finished otp-email, the payload will look like:

```json
{
    "st-mfa": {
        "c": {
            "emailpassword": 1702877939,
            "otp-email": 1702877999
        },
        "v": true
    }
}
```

Indicating that the user has finished all required factors, and should be allowed to access the app.

:::caution
If you are already using `Passwordless` or `ThirdPartyPasswordless` in your app as a first factor, you do not need to explicitly initialise the Passwordless recipe again.
:::

### Frontend setup

There are two parts to this:
- Configuring the frontend to show the OTP challenge UI when required during login / sign up
- Allowing users to enable / disable OTP challenge on their account via the settings page (If you are following Example 2 from above).

The first part is identical to the steps mentioned in [this section](./otp-for-all-users#frontend-setup), so please follow that.

The second part, which is only applicable in case you want to allow users to enable / disable OTP themselves, can be achieved by creating the following flow on your frontend:
- When the user navigates to their settings page, you can show them if OTP challenge is enabled or not.
- If enabled, you can allow them to disable it, or vice versa.

In order to know if the user has enabled OTP, you can make an API your backend which calls the following function:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```ts
import MultiFactorAuth from "supertokens-node/recipe/multifactorauth";

async function isOTPEmailEnabledForUser(userId: string) {
    let factors = await MultiFactorAuth.getRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser(userId)
    return factors.includes("otp-email")
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

:::

</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

If the user wants to enable or disable otp-email for them, you can make an API on your backend which calls the following function:

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```ts
import MultiFactorAuth from "supertokens-node/recipe/multifactorauth";

async function enableMFAForUser(userId: string) {
    await MultiFactorAuth.addToRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser(userId, "otp-email")
}

async function disableMFAForUser(userId: string) {
    await MultiFactorAuth.removeFromRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser(userId, "otp-email")
}
```

</TabItem>

:::

</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

:::note
If instead you want to work with `otp-phone`, you can replace `otp-email` with `otp-phone` in the above snippets. Also make sure that the `contactMethod` is set to `PHONE` in the Passwordless recipe on the frontend (for pre built UI) and backend.
:::


## Multi tenant setup

### Backend setup
A user can be a part of several tenants. So if you want OTP to be enabled for a specific user across all the tenants that they are a part of, the steps are the same as in the [Backend setup](#backend-setup) section above.

However, if you want OTP to be enabled for a specific user, for a specific tenant (or a sub set of tenants that the user is a part of), then you will have to add additional logic to the `getMFARequirementsForAuth` function override. Modifying the example code from the [Backend setup](#backend-setup) section above:

We provide an override for `getMFARequirementsForAuth` which checks if otp-email is enabled for the user, and also take into account the tenantId to decide if we want to have this user go through the otp-email flow whilst logging into this tenant. The implementation of `shouldRequireOTPEmailForTenant` is entirely up to you.

### Frontend setup
The frontend setup is identical to the [frontend setup](#frontend-setup) section above.

## Protecting frontend and backend routes

See the section on [protecting frontend and backend routes](../protect-routes).

## Email / SMS sending and design
By default, the email template used for otp-email login is [as shown here](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates?tab=readme-ov-file#otp-login), and the default SMS template is [as shown here](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates?tab=readme-ov-file#otp-login-1). The method for sending them is via an email and sms sending service that we provide.

If you would like to learn more about this, or change the content of the email, or the method by which they are sent, checkout the email / sms delivery section in the recipe docs:
