# TOTP for specific users

In this page, we will show you how to implement an MFA policy that requires certain users to do TOTP. You can decide which those users are based on any criteria. For example:
- Only users that have an `admin` role require to do TOTP; OR
- Only users that have enabled TOTP on their account require to do TOTP; OR
- Only users that have a paid account require to do TOTP.

Whatever the criteria is, the steps to implementing this type of a flow is the same.

:::note
We assume that the first factor is [email password or social login](/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/introduction), but the same set of steps will be applicable for other first factor types as well.

We override the `getMFARequirementsForAuth` function to indicate that `totp` must be completed only for users that have the `admin` role. You can also have any other criteria here.

We simply initialise the multi factor auth recipe here without any override to `getMFARequirementsForAuth`. The default implementation of this function already checks what factors are enabled for a user and returns those. So all we need to do is mark `totp` as enabled for a user as soon as they have setup a device successfuly. This happens in the `verifyDevicePOST` API override as shown above. Once a device is verified, we mark the `totp` factor as enabled for the user, and the next time they login, they will be asked to complete the TOTP challenge.

</details>

In both of the examples above, notice that we have initialised the TOTP recipe in the `recipeList`. Here are some of the configrations you can add to the `totp.init` function:
- `issuer`: This is the name that will show up in the TOTP app for the user. By default, this is equal to the `appName` config, however, you can change it to something else using this property.
- `defaultSkew`: The default value of this is `1`, which means that TOTP codes that were generated 1 tick before, and that will be generated 1 tick after from the current tick will be accepted at any given time (including the TOTP of the current tick, of course).
-  `defaultPeriod`: The default value of this is `30`, which means that the current tick is valie for 30 seconds. So by default, a TOTP code that's just shown to the user, is valid for 60 seconds (`defaultPeriod + defaultSkew*defaultPeriod` seconds)
- `getUserIdentifierInfoForUserId`: This is a function which takes in a userId and returns an identifier for the user (if there is one). By default, this is the email or phone number of the user from the first factor, but you can change that behaviour by providing an implementation for this function.

Once the user finishes the first factor (for example, with emailpassword), their session access token payload will look like this (for those that require TOTP):
```json
{
    "st-mfa": {
        "c": {
            "emailpassword": 1702877939,
        },
        "v": false
    }
}
```

The `v` being `false` indicates that there are still factors that are pending. After the user has finished totp, the payload will look like:

```json
{
    "st-mfa": {
        "c": {
            "emailpassword": 1702877939,
            "totp": 1702877999
        },
        "v": true
    }
}
```

Indicating that the user has finished all required factors, and should be allowed to access the app.

### Frontend setup

There are two parts to this:
- Configuring the frontend to show the TOTP UI when required during login / sign up
- Allowing users to enable / disable TOTP on their account via the settings page (If you are following Example 2 from above).

The first part is identical to the steps mentioned in [this section](./totp-for-all-users#frontend-setup), so please follow that.

The second part, which is only applicable in case you want to allow users to enable / disable TOTP themselves, can be achieved by creating the following flow on your frontend:
- When the user navigates to their settings page, you can show them if TOTP is enabled or not.
- If enabled, you can show them a list of current TOTP devices with options to remove any.
- If enabled, you can show them an option to add a new TOTP device.

In order to know if the user has enabled TOTP, you can make an API your backend which calls the following function:

<!-- COPY SECTION -->
<!-- ./mfa/backend-setup.mdx -->
<!-- 1 -->

<TabItem value="nodejs">

import MultiFactorAuth from "supertokens-node/recipe/multifactorauth";

    let factors = await MultiFactorAuth.getRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser(userId)
    return factors.includes("totp")
}
```

    await MultiFactorAuth.removeFromRequiredSecondaryFactorsForUser(userId, "totp")
}

In order to add a new device, you can call the following function from the frontend. This function will redirect the user to the TOTP create device pre built UI. After the user has finished the new device creation and verification, they will be redirected back to the current page:

```tsx
import MultiFactorAuth from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/multifactorauth';

async function redirectToTotpSetupScreen() {
    MultiFactorAuth.redirectToFactor(MultiFactorAuth.Factors.TOTP, true, true)
}
```

- In the snippet above, we redirect to the [TOTP factor setup screen](https://6571be2867f75556541fde98-xieqfaxuuo.chromatic.com/?path=/story/totp-mfa--device-setup-with-single-next-option). The second argument represents a boolean for `forceSetup` which we set to true since we want the user to setup a new TOTP device. The third arg is also `true` since we want to redirect back to the current page after the user has finished setting up the device.
- You can also just redirect the user to `/{websiteBasePath}/mfa/totp?setup=true&redirectToPath={currentPath}` if you don't want to use the above function.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="angular">

In order to add a new device, you can redirect the user to `/{websiteBasePath}/mfa/totp?setup=true&redirectToPath={currentPath}` from your settings page. This will show the [TOTP factor setup screen](https://6571be2867f75556541fde98-xieqfaxuuo.chromatic.com/?path=/story/totp-mfa--device-setup-with-single-next-option) to the user:
- We add the query param of `setup=true` because we want to create a new device.
- The `redirectToPath` query param will also tell our SDK to redirect the user back to the current page after they have finished creating the device.

</TabItem>

</FrontendPreBuiltUITabs>

After the user has finished creating a device, our backend override for `verifyDevicePOST` (see "Example 2" in [Backend setup section](#backend-setup) above) will add totp as a required factor for this user, so that next time they login, they will be asked to complete the TOTP challenge.

</PreBuiltUIContent>

<CustomUIContent>

In order to create a new device, you should redirect the user to a page which creates a new TOTP device on the backend, asks the user to scan the QR code and then to enter the TOTP in order to verify the new device. This can be achieved by calling the functions mentioned in [this section](./totp-for-all-users#case-1-implementation-user-needs-to-setup-a-new-totp-device--cust).

</CustomUIContent>

</PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>


## Multi tenant setup

### Backend setup
A user can be a part of several tenants. So if you want TOTP to be enabled for a specific user across all the tenants that they are a part of, the steps are the same as in the [Backend setup](#backend-setup) section above.

However, if you want TOTP to be enabled for a specific user, for a specific tenant (or a sub set of tenants that the user is a part of), then you will have to add additional logic to the `getMFARequirementsForAuth` function override. Modifying the example code from the [Backend setup](#backend-setup) section above:

- We provide an override for `getMFARequirementsForAuth` which checks if TOTP is enabled for the user, and also take into account the tenantId to decide if we want to have this user go through the TOTP flow whilst logging into this tenant. The implementation of `shouldRequireTotpForTenant` is entirely up to you.
