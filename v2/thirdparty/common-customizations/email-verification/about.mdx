# Enable email verification

:::info
- Email verification is turned off by default. It is strongly encouraged to enable it to ensure the authenticity of your users.
- If you are already using SuperTokens in production and turn on email verification, your users will be redirected to the email verification screen next time they use your application.
:::

## Switch on Email Verification

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters} from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}.init({
            ^{reactRecipeInitDefault} // typecheck-only, removed from output
            // highlight-start
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                mode: "REQUIRED"
            }
        }),
        // highlight-end
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## The default UI

When a new user signs up with an unverified email, they will receive an email to verify their address and be redirected to the following screen:

<img alt="Email verification UI when the link in email is not clicked" width="500px" src="/img/emailpassword/verify-email-screen.png" />

After they have clicked on the email, they will see this screen:

<img alt="Email verification UI once the link in email is clicked" width="500px" src="/img/emailpassword/email-verification-successful.png" />
