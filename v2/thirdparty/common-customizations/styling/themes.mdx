# Themes ðŸŽ­
Combining the techniques described in the previous two sections we have created three themes which can be found [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-typescript/src/Themes). These are being used in the following demos which you can play around with by navigating to respective links.

## Default Theme ([See working demo](https://thirdparty.demo.supertokens.com))
