## ThirdParty Migration

To migrate users with social accounts we can simply call the SuperTokens Core's `signInUp` API with the provider Id and the user's third party userId.

For example:

If we were importing a user with Google as their provider with their third party userId being `106347997792363870000`, we can run the following curl command to import the user.  

<CoreInjector>

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{coreInjector_uri_without_quotes}/recipe/signinup' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "thirdPartyId": "google",
  "thirdPartyUserId": "106347997792363870000",
  "email": {
    "id": "johndoe@gmail.com"
  }
}'
```

</CoreInjector>
