<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ThirdParty from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdparty";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        ThirdParty.init({
            // highlight-start
            override: {
                functions: (originalImplementation) => {
                    return {
                        ...originalImplementation,

                        // we will only be overriding what happens when a user
                        // clicks the sign in or sign up button.
                        signInAndUp: async function (input) {
                            // TODO: some custom logic

                            // or call the default behaviour as show below
                            return originalImplementation.signInAndUp(input);
                        },
                        // ...
                        // TODO: override more functions
                    }
                }
            }

- `originalImplementation` is an object that contains functions that have the original implementation for this and the email verification recipe. They can be used in your functions as a way to use the SuperTokens' default behaviour.
- In the above code snippet, we override the `signInAndUp` function of this recipe. This means that after the user is navigated back to the your app post auth (from the third party provider), your function will be called with the relevant `input` object.
- Likewise, we override the `isEmailVerified` function for the email verification recipe. This means that when a user signs in / up, and if email verification is in `"REQUIRED"` mode, then your function will be called to check if that user's email is verified or not.
