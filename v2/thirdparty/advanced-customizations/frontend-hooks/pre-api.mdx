# Pre API Hook

This function is called before any API call is being made to your backend from our frontend SDK. You can use this to change the request body / url / header or any other request property.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import ThirdParty from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdparty";

ThirdParty.init({
    preAPIHook: async (context) => {
        let url = context.url;

        // is the fetch config object that contains the header, body etc..
        let requestInit = context.requestInit;

        let action = context.action;
        if (action === "GET_AUTHORISATION_URL") {

        } else if (action === "THIRD_PARTY_SIGN_IN_UP") {
            // Note: this could either be sign in or sign up.
            // we don't know that at the time of the API call
            // since all we have is the authorisation code from
            // the social provider

        } else if (action === "VERIFY_EMAIL") {

        }

        // events such as sign out are in the 
        // session recipe pre API hook (See the info box below)

        return {
            requestInit, url
        };
    }
})
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

:::info
Also checkout the [session recipe pre API hook](/docs/session/advanced-customizations/frontend-hooks/pre-api) for events such as sign out. These will need to go in the `Session.init` config object.
