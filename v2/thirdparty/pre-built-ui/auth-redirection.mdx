# Auth redirection

## Change redirection path post login

<FrontendPreBuiltUITabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

By default, the user is redirected the the `/` route on your website post login. To change this, you can use the `getRedirectionURL` function on the frontend as shown below:

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters} from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
        ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}.init({
            ^{reactRecipeInitDefault} // typecheck-only, removed from output
            // highlight-start
            getRedirectionURL: async (context) => {
                if (context.action === "SUCCESS") {
                    if (context.redirectToPath !== undefined) {
                        // we are navigating back to where the user was before they authenticated
                        return context.redirectToPath;
                    }
                    return "/dashboard";
                }
                return undefined;
            }
            // highlight-end
        }),
    ]
});
```

The user will be redirected to the provided URL on:
- Successful sign up.
- Successful sign in.
- Successful email verification post sign up.
- If the user is already logged in.

If you want to redirect the user to a different domain, then you can do so by first redirecting them to a specific path using the function above, which further redirects them to the final domain.

## Redirect user to the login page

<FrontendPreBuiltUITabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

Use the `redirectToAuth({show?: "signin" | "signup", redirectBack?: boolean}?)` function to redirect the user to the login screen. For example, you may want to call this function when the user clicks on the login button.

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
import React from "react";
import { redirectToAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react";

function NavBar () {
  async function onLogin () {
    // highlight-next-line
    redirectToAuth(); 
  }
  return (
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        // highlight-next-line
        <li onClick={onLogin}>Login</li> 

    </ul>
  )
}
```

- Call `redirectToAuth({show: "signin"})` to take them to the sign in screen
- Call `redirectToAuth({show: "signup"})` to take them to the sign up screen
- If you do not want the user to be redirected to the current page post sign in, use `redirectToAuth({redirectBack: false})`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="angular">

To navigate the user to the login page, you can set `window.location.href` to the value of `websiteBasePath` config (`/auth` by default).

To show the sign in page on redirect, you want to add the query param `?show=signin` to the URL. To show the sign up page on redirect, you want to add `?show=signup` instead.

To make the user navigate back to their current page, you should add the query param `?redirectToPath=/somepath`.

For example if the user is currently on the `/dashboard` page and is not logged in, you can navigate them to the sign in page like this:

```tsx
window.location.href = "/auth?show=signin&redirectToPath=/dashboard"
```

This will show the sign in page and post login, will redirect the user back to `/dashboard`.

</TabItem>
