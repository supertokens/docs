# Testing with Postman

The following guide will go over the process of testing backend APIs with Postman. These APIs are automatically exposed via our backend SDK (`/auth/*` path).

:::important
- Make sure that the ThirdParty Recipe is correctly setup in your backend 
- For the examples given below we will be running our backend on domain `localhost` and port `3001`
- The Open API spec for the APIs being tested can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/supertokens/FDI).
- Postman does cookie management on its own. So you don't need to manually set cookies on each request.
:::

## 1. Signup
The `/auth/signinup` API requires the `redirectURI`, `thirdPartyId` and `code` attributes to be set as a JSON object in the request body. 
  - `redirectURI`: It is the link the user is redirected to after authentication. For example, for sign in with Google, the value of this will be `{websiteDomain}/auth/callback/google`. 
  - `thirdPartyId`: The id used to identify the provider. For example if Google is enabled as a ThirdParty provider its `thirdPartyId` is `google`
  - `code`: The auth code that is sent by the third party provider when the `redirectURI` is called (post auth from their UI). 

  - On a successful response, a new user session will be created with session tokens being set in the response and the response body will contain the `user` object, the `createdNewUser` and `status` values as JSON data.

  - The following session tokens are set:
    - `sIdRefreshToken`
    - `sAccessToken`
    - `sRefreshToken`

- More information about these cookies can be found [here](../common-customizations/sessions/cookie-consent)


## 2. Session Verification

- We can also test APIs which require the user to be logged in.

- For example, we have an API used to query user data with the `verifySession` middleware as shown below

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import express from "express";
import { verifySession } from "supertokens-node/recipe/session/framework/express";

let app = express();

// The following code snippet is an example API. You do not need to 
// implement it in your app

app.post("/change-user-data", verifySession(), async (req, res) => {
    let userId = req.session.getUserId();
    // mutate some user data
    res.send({
        userId
    })
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go">

```go
import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/recipe/session"
	"github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/supertokens"
)

// The following code snippet is an example API. You do not need to
// implement it in your app

func main() {
	http.ListenAndServe(":3001", supertokens.Middleware(http.HandlerFunc(func(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Handle your APIs..

		if r.URL.Path == "/change-user-data" {
			session.VerifySession(nil, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
				sessionContainer := session.GetSessionFromRequestContext(r.Context())

				w.WriteHeader(200)
				w.Header().Add("content-type", "application/json")
				bytes, err := json.Marshal(map[string]interface{}{
					"userId": sessionContainer.GetUserID(),
				})
				if err != nil {
					w.WriteHeader(500)
					w.Write([]byte("error in converting to json"))
				} else {
					w.Write(bytes)
				}

			}).ServeHTTP(rw, r)
			return
		}
	})))
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
# The following code snippet is an example API (fastapi). You do not need to 
# implement it in your app

from supertokens_python.recipe.session.framework.fastapi import verify_session
from supertokens_python.recipe.session import SessionContainer
from fastapi import Depends

@app.post('/change-user-data') # type: ignore
async def update_jwt(session: SessionContainer = Depends(verify_session())):
    _ = session.get_user_id()
	# mutate some user data
	# send response
```

</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/change-user-data`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `thirdparty`.
- If you have the `antiCsrf` attribute set to `VIA_TOKEN` in your backend SuperTokens config then, in the Postman Header tab, set a key as `anti-csrf` and value as the `anti-csrf` token retrieved from the login response.
- On a successful response, the response body will contain user data.

:::important
By default, for `GET` APIs, you don't need to provide the `anti-csrf` request header as anti-CSRF checks are only done in non-`GET` APIs
:::

In case you query the `/change-user-data` API with an expired access token, you will get a `401` response with the message `try refresh token`. 

<img width="600px" src="/img/emailpassword/st-user-unauthorized.png" />

To generate new session tokens you can use the `/auth/session/refresh` API as shown in the next section.


## 3. Refreshing Session Tokens

In case your `access token` expires you can call the `/auth/session/refresh` api to generate a new  `access token` and `refresh token`.
- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/auth/session/refresh`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `thirdparty`.
- On a successful response, new session tokens will be set

<img width="600px" src="/img/emailpassword/st-ep-refresh.png" />

You can see the new session tokens by switching to the cookies tab

## 4. Logout

The `/auth/signout` API will be used to invalidate the  user sessions. This will clear the session cookies set in postman.
- In Postman, set the request type to `POST`.
- Set the URL to `http://localhost:3001/auth/signout`
- In the Header tab, set key `rid` with value `session`.
- On a successful response, the session tokens will be cleared from Postman, and from the database
