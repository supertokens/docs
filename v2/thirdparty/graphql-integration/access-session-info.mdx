# Access Session Info In GraphQL Operations

GraphQL passes the context object (refer to [backend setup](./backend-setup#d-add-a-graphql-endpoint-with-optional-session-verification)) to your resolvers, you can use this context to set and read session information.

```jsx
var resolvers = {
    foo: (_, context) => {
        if (context.session !== undefined) {
            // Use the session object, for example context.session.getUserId()
        } else {
            // Session does not exist
        }
    }
}
```

Refer to [this page](../common-customizations/sessions/session-verification-in-api/verify-session#the-session-object) to know more about the session object
