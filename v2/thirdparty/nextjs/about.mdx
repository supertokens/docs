# About

## Overview steps

Integrating SuperTokens with a Next.js app involves:
- Calling the frontend and backend init functions
- Adding a website page to display the auth related widgets (on `/auth` by default)
- Creating a serverless function to expose the auth related APIs which will be consumed by the frontend widgets (on `/api/auth/` by default)
- Protecting website routes: Displaying them only when a user is logged in, else redirecting them to the login page
- Performing session verification:
    - In your APIs
    - In `getServerSideProps`

Each of these will be covered in the next few pages. Rest of the customizations can be done by following the "Common customizations" section.

## Try an example app
Download and run an example NextJS app quickly using the following command:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest --frontend=next --recipe=^{codeImportRecipeName}
```
