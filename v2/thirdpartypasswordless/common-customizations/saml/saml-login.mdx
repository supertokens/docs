# How to add SAML login to SuperTokens?

SuperTokens is not a SAML client. This means, that you will have to use a third party solution along with SuperTokens to integrate with a SAML provider. The way this will work is that the third party solution will act as an OAuth 2.0 provider to SuperTokens, and a SAML client to the SAML provider:

You can integrate any third party provider easily using our [custom OAuth provider integration](../signup-form/custom-providers) feature. The following pages in this section will guide you through some examples of third party solutions that you can use alongside of SuperTokens.
