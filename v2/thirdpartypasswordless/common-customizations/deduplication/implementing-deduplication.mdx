# Implementing account deduplication

The approach to implementing account deduplication is to override the backend functions / APIs which create a user such that:
- We check if a user already exists with that email.
- If a user does not exist, we call the original implementation; Else
- We return a message to the frontend telling the user why sign up was rejected.

Add the following override logic to `ThirdPartyPasswordless.init` on the backend

In the above code snippet, we override the `thirdPartySignInUpPOST` and the `createCodePOST` API as well as the `thirdPartySignInUp` recipe function.

The `thirdPartySignInUpPOST` API is called by the frontend after the user is redirected back to your app from the third party provider's login page. The API then exchanges the auth code with the provider and calls the `signInUp` function with the user's email and thirdParty info.

The `createCodePOST` API is called when the user enters their email, or phone number during passwordless login. This API generates the passwordless OTP / link and sends it to the user's email / phone.

We override the `thirdPartySignInUp` recipe function to:
- Get all ThirdParty or Passwordless users that have the same input email.
- If no users exist with that email, it means that this is a new email and so we call the `originalImplementation` function which creates a new user.
- If instead, a user exists, but has the same `thirdPartyId` and `thirdPartyUserId`, implying that this is a sign in (for example a user who had signed up with Google is signing in with Google), we again allow the operation by calling the `originalImplementation` function.
- If neither of the conditions above match, it means that the user is trying to sign up with a third party provider whilst they already have an account with another provider or via passwordless login. So here we throw an error with some custom message.

Finally, we override the `signInUpPOST` API to catch that custom error and return a [general error status](../../advanced-customizations/apis-override/custom-response/general-error) to the frontend with a message that will be displayed to the user in the sign in form.

We also override the `createCodePOST` API to perform similar checks:
- If the input is phone number based, then we call the `originalImplementation` function allowing sign up or sign in. This is OK since social login is always email based, so there is no scope of duplication.
- Otherwise, we det all ThirdParty or Passwordless users that have the same input email.
- If no users exist with that email, it means that this is a new email and so we call the `originalImplementation` function which creates a new user.
- Else we check if the existing user is not a Third Party login user, implying that it's a Passwordless login user. So here, we also call the `originalImplementation` function to allow the user to sign in.
- If neither of the conditions above match, it means that the user is trying to sign up with passwordless login whilst they already have an account with a third party provider. So here we return an appropriate message to be displayed on the frontend.

<CustomAdmonition type="multi-tenancy">

For a multi tenant setup, the customisations above ensure that multiple accounts with the same email don't exist within a single tenant. If you want to ensure that there is no duplication across all tenants, then when fetching the list of existing users, you should loop through all tenants in your app, which you can fetch by using the `listAllTenants` function of the multi tenancy recipe.
