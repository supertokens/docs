# Redirection Callback Hook

This function is used to change where the user is redirected to post certain actions. For example, you can use this to redirect a user to a specific URL post sign in / up.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import ThirdPartyPasswordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartypasswordless";

ThirdPartyPasswordless.init({
    contactMethod: "EMAIL", // This example will work with any contactMethod.
    getRedirectionURL: async (context) => {
        if (context.action === "SUCCESS") {
            // called on a successful sign in / up. Where should the user go next?
            let redirectToPath = context.redirectToPath;
            if (redirectToPath !== undefined) {
                // we are navigating back to where the user was before they authenticated
                return redirectToPath;
            }
            if (context.isNewUser) {
                // user signed up
                return "/onboarding"
            } else {
                // user signed in
                return "/dashboard"
            }
        }
        // return undefined to let the default behaviour play out
        return undefined;
    }
});
```
</TabItem>
