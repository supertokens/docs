The frontend authentication route defines how authentication-related requests are processed and routed within your application's frontend.

Under `app/routes`, create `auth.$.tsx` file.

At this stage, your `app/routes` folder should resemble the following:

ðŸ“¦routes
â”— ðŸ“œauth.$.tsx

Add the following code to the `auth.$.tsx` file:

```tsx title="app/routes/auth.$.tsx"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { redirectToAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react";
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react/ui/index.js";
import { ^{recipePreBuiltUINameCapitalLetters} } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}/prebuiltui.js";
import { EmailVerificationPreBuiltUI } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailverification/prebuiltui.js";

export const PreBuiltUIList = [^{recipePreBuiltUINameCapitalLetters}];

export default function Auth() {
  // If the user visits a page that is not handled by us (like /auth/random), then we redirect them back to the auth page.
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (SuperTokens.canHandleRoute(PreBuiltUIList) === false) {
      redirectToAuth({ redirectBack: false });
    } else {
      setLoaded(true);
    }
  }, []);

  if (loaded) {
    return SuperTokens.getRoutingComponent(PreBuiltUIList);
  }

  return null;
}
```

Let's review the code:

1. Within `$.tsx`, the `Auth` component determines if SuperTokens can handle the current route based on the provided `PreBuiltUIList`, which contains UI components related to authentication. If the current route matches any routes that SuperTokens can handle, it means that the authentication process can proceed.

2. If the current route cannot be handled by SuperTokens (meaning it's not an authentication-related route), the user is redirected to the authentication page using `redirectToAuth({ redirectBack: false })`.

3. If the current route can be handled by SuperTokens (i.e., it's an authentication-related route), the `loaded` state is set to `true`, indicating that the authentication process is ready to proceed and that the component is fully loaded and initialized.

4. When `getRoutingComponent` is called with `PreBuiltUIList` as an argument, it examines the current route and matches it with the appropriate UI component from the list. Once the matching component is identified, it returns the Remix renders component.
