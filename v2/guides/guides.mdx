# Guided Tutorial


<StackAndAuthMethodSelector />


## Comments (Not visible in the final docs)

The docs are split on per-file basis. Each file includes all the authentication methods for a tech stack combination.
We do it this way for several reasons:
- We have an easier time editing and understanding smaller documents that do not have that many conditions
- We can compose those files using common building blocks for each section
- It's easier to understand the structure of the documentation and what each page should do
