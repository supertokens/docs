# Guided Tutorial

<!-- To Do:  -->
<!-- - [x] Decide on the document structure -->
<!-- - [ ] Add an initial draft with just the text content -->
<!-- - [ ] Add code snippets -->
<!-- - [ ] Add the correct reference links to the docs -->
<!-- - [ ] Improve the text based on feedback -->
<!-- - [ ] Add the images -->
<!-- - [ ] Add a proper component that will show your selection    -->
<!-- - [ ] Improve the guide selection form -->

## Your Selection


<DisplaySelection />

#### Backend Service Structure 

<Condition title="Uses a backend that does not have an SDK" match={true}>

Follow the steps described [here](/docs/community/other-frameworks) to get a better understanding on how you can spin up a separate authentication server and the integrate it in your existing backend infrastructure.
