## Architecture Overview

### {No SDK Support}

:::note
For custom architecture we will need a image without "PHP server". Just say "Your API" or something like that.
:::

![Architecture Schema](/img/other-framework-setup.png)


#### {Java/C#/PHP}

We do not have an SDK in the language that you have chosen. You will have to deploy
and expose a separate authentication server from your infrastructure. 

#### {Go/Python with MTA/MFA}

At the moment we do not support MFA, Multi-factor authentication, in the language SDK. You will have to deploy a separate Node.js server 
and expose the authentication routes.

Let's look at the example above to better undestand how everything should be set up.
The diagram shows a simple architecture in which a client frontend communicates, through a reverse proxy, with both the Node.js/Go/Python server 
and your existing backend API.
- The **Frontend SDK** will call the authentication routes and will automatically refresh the authentication flow if your Backend API returns `401` responses.
- The Node.js/Go/Python server will expose the authentication routes. It will use our **Backend SDK** to complete the authentication flows and communicate with the **SuerTokens Core Service**.
- You current API will have to [verify](/docs/verify) the JWT session tokens in order to validate if the user is authenticated. The tokens will be attached to each request by the Frontend SDK.

To get a more extensive walkthrough on how the SuperTokens Architecture works, please refer to [this page](/docs/architecture).

You can also find out more instructions on how to deploy a separate authentication server in our [extensive guide](/docs/community/other-frameworks).


### {Anything Else}

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


You can directly integrate SuperTokens in your existing services. The authentication routes will be properly exposed based on your configuration.
There are three main components that you need to keep in mind here:
- Frontend SDK - Provides pre built UI, helper functions and / or session management on the frontend.
- Backend SDK -  Provides a middleware which exposes all the auth related APIs for your frontend to call. It also handles session management and access control for your APIs.
- SuperTokens Core Service - This is called by the backend SDK to maintain state in the database. This can either be self hosted using docker or be managed by us if you sign up on supertokens.com

:::note 
Should we explain other terms here? Like Recipes and stuff

## Project Structure

### {Has Starter Project}

Use our starter project to get up and running quickly. It comes with full config examples 
based on your selection. Just run the following command to install everything:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest some-arguments 
```

### {Default App Structure}

The project that you just downloaded is split into two parts:

### `/backend`

This folder includes a sample server that exposes the authentication routes.

#### {Node.js/Express}

There are two files included in this project. 

##### `config.ts`

As the name suggests, this file configures the SuperTokens SDK and the features that your instance will use.
In it, you will find examples for the following setup steps:

1. Connecting to the **SuperTokens Core Service** 
2. Specifying details about your application 
3. Selecting and initialising the authentication **recipes** that you need
4. Configuring additional functionality like session or user management

##### `index.ts`

This file initializes a simple Express server that makes use of two functions to expose the auth functionalities:
- `middleware`: This adds the authentication routes to the Express App 
- `errorHandler`: This manages the errors that can be thrown in the authentication flows and includes standardized responses

Besides that, you will also find examples on how to configure CORS, and how to setup two additional endpoints. One for managing session data and one for working with tenants. 

:::note
should we specify the tenant endpoint info only if it is set in the config?
:::

#### {Node.js/NestJS}

##### `/auth`

This section can be copy and pasted directly into your existing project without any additional changes. 
In here you will find abstractions for initializing the **SDK**, communicating with the [**SuperTokens Core Service**](/core-service) and common **NestJS** utilities like `guards`, `filters`, `decorators` and `middlewares`.

TODO: Talk about how the middleware will expose the auth routes

##### `config.ts`

In here you define a set of constants that describe configurations details on how the authentication flows will work based on your specific use case.
The file includes information on the general app config that you should provide, the [SuperTokens Core Service](/core-service) endpoint, and the [recipes](/recipes) that will be used in your deployment.

##### `app.controller.ts`

Check this file for examples on how to use the guards and decorators exposed by the `/auth` folder. This way you can protect your endpoints and access session specific data.

##### `app.module.ts`

Provides an example of how to import the authentication functionality in your main **NestJS** module.

##### `module.ts`

Includes a `bootstrap` call that configures CORS and sets up an exception filter that will catch any authentication related errors and return proper responses.

#### {Python/FastApi}

:::note
How do we include framework specific info? Do we extend the form options?
:::

##### `config.py`

The config file exports a series of variables that will be used to initialize the **SuperTokens SDK** and specify which authentication flows to include.
In here you will find examples on how to:

- Setup the the **SuperTokens Core Service** connection
- Specify details about your application 
- Describe which authentication **recipes** your app will use 
- Configure additional functionality like session or user management

##### `app.py`

This is where the SDK gets initialised based on the configuration that we have previously defined. 
The authentication routes get included in your app through the `get_middleware` call.
Other than that, the file includes examples on how you can secure your routes, manage session data, and how to configure CORS settings so that authenticaiton will properly work.

#### {Go}

##### `config.go`

The config file exports a variable that will be used to initialize the **SuperTokens SDK** and specify which authentication flows to include.
In here you will find examples on how to:

- Setup the the **SuperTokens Core Service** connection
- Specify details about your application 
- Describe which authentication **recipes** your app will use 
- Configure additional functionality like session or user management

##### `main.go`

This is where the SDK gets initialised based on the configuration that we have previously defined. 
The authentication routes get included in your app through the `supertokens.Middleware` call.
Other than that, the file includes examples on how you can secure your routes, manage session data, and how to configure CORS settings so that authenticaiton will properly work.

We will include references to these files throught the following sections. This way you fill find concrete instructions on how and what to change based on your selected recipes and setup. 

### `/frontend`

This folder includes a basic *SPA*, single page app, that uses the [SuperTokens Frontend SDK](/frontend-sdk) and a series of prebuilt components to provide an 
authentication UI for users.

#### {React}

##### `config.ts`

This file exports two main constants. The `SuperTokensConfig` object that describes the properties that should be used when we initialise the SDK.
The `PreBuiltUIList`, which includes a series of prebuilt components that will be used in the authentication flows. 
In here you will have to adjust the `getApiDomain` and `getWebsiteDomain` functions based on your existing app setup.  
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication recipe. But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `App.tsx`

Here is where we make use of the previously defined config and we start everything off.
1. The SDK gets initialised based on the configuration that we have previously defined. 
2. The entire app tree is wrapped with the `SuperTokensWrapper` component. This will provide a state context that can be used in our next components.
2. The authentication routes get included by calling `getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom` with our previously defined UI list.
3. Routes that should be protected by the SDK are wrapped with the `SessionAuth` component

#### {Angular}

##### `config.ts`

This file exports two functions:
- `initSuperTokensUI` 
- `initSuperTokensWebJS`, 
In here you will have to adjust the `appInfo` section based on your existing app setup. 
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication [recipe](/recipes). But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `app/auth`

##### `app/app-routing.module.ts`

##### `app/app.component.ts`

#### {Vue}

##### `config.ts`

This file exports two functions:
- `initSuperTokensUI` 
- `initSuperTokensWebJS`, 
In here you will have to adjust the `appInfo` section based on your existing app setup. 
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication [recipe](/recipes). But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `/router`
##### `/views`
##### `/main.ts`


### {For Next.js}

:::note
Do we include options about the app router version in the initial form? 
:::

##### `/api`
##### `/config`
##### `/components`
##### `/auth`
##### `layout.tsx`

### {Does not have a Starter Project}

## Followup Questions

- What's the photo for the baseline architecture? (the one where you use the SDK)
- How do I access the chat of a previous huddle? :)
- Do we have a way of referencing the SDK version in the docs?
- How do I access the example gists
- Should we generate all the possible pages during build time? SEO concerns.
- Not sure on what would work best for abstracting/modularising this.

## SuperTokens backend configuration

Open up the file <RenderBackendConfigPath /> from the downloaded folder. This is where SuperTokens's backend SDK is configured. There are different parts to the configuration:

- Connection to the core..
- `appInfo`:
    - The value of `apiDomain` is: <RenderAPIDomain />. This is where the auth APIs will be exposed to to the frontend.
    - The value of `websiteDomain` is: <RenderWebsiteDomain />. <IsMobileFrontend>Since your frontend is a mobile app, this value does not matter much. It's used when generating links like email verification or password reset (if you have chosen email password), however, we override these links in the backend config to be deep links to the mobile app before sending them to the user's email.</IsMobileFrontend><IsWebFrontend>This link is where your frontend UI will show.</IsWebFrontend>

<IsRecipeInit recipe="passwordless"><li> Passwordless recipe: This recipe exposes the passwordless login based APIs (for magic link or otp based login).</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="thirdparty"><li> Third Party recipe: Exposes APIs for social or enterprise SSO login. This list of third party providers will be configured via API calls for each tenant in your application.</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="mfa"><li> Multi factor recipe: Allows you to configure secondary factors required for each tenant. We will provide a list of first and second factors for each tenant during the tenant configuration step.</li></IsRecipeInit>
</ul>
</ul>

### Configuring tenants

There are two steps in configuring tenants:
- Creating tenants and setting login methods for them.
- If third party is enabled for the tenant, then we want to configure the third party providers for the tenant.
