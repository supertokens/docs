Besides all the authentication recipes that get initialized in the `recipeList` array, you might have noticed another call, `Session.init()`.
This enables the session management functionalities that **SuperTokens** provides for your application.

To protect your backend routes, you will have to include the `verifySession` middleware in the route definition code. 
The function limits endpoint access only to authenticated requests. It will also add the `session` object in `request` argument. We also expose a `SessionRequest` interface so that you can work with a proper types in your handler.

On the frontend we export a `SessionAuth` component that you can use as a wrapper over routes that require authentication.
