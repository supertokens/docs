If we look at our example app we can see that there are no custom configurations added to the backend server. 
That is because tenant configuration is done when we create or update a tenant.
You can do this by using the **Backend SDK** and calling the `createOrUpdateTenant` function.
Check the [create tenant guide](/guide) for more details.
