You can directly integrate SuperTokens in your existing services. The authentication routes will be properly exposed based on your configuration.

There are three main components that you need to keep in mind here:
- The **Frontend SDK** - Provides pre built UI components and functions to manage authentication from your frontend app.
- The **Backend SDK** - Comunicates with the **Core Service** and provides a middleware which exposes all the auth related APIs for your frontend to call. It also handles session management and access control for your application.
- The **SuperTokens Core Service** - This is called by the backend SDK to maintain state in the database. This can either be self hosted using docker or be managed by us if you sign up on supertokens.com

To get a more extensive walkthrough on how the SuperTokens Architecture works, please refer to [this page](/docs/architecture).
