##### `config.go`

The config file exports a variable that will be used to initialize the **SuperTokens SDK** and specify which authentication flows to include.
In here you will find examples on how to:

- Setup the the **SuperTokens Core Service** connection. Replace the endpoint with the correct one based on your configuration.
- Specify details about your application. Update the `AppInfo` section with information specific to your application.
- Describe which authentication **recipes** your app will use. You will have to modify the parameters for each recipe with your own configuration values. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections.
- Configure additional functionality like session or user management

##### `main.go`

This is where the SDK gets initialised based on the configuration that we have previously defined. 
The authentication routes get included in your app through the `supertokens.Middleware` call.
Other than that, the file includes examples on how you can secure your routes, manage session data, and how to configure CORS settings so that authenticaiton will properly work.

We will include references to these files throught the following sections. This way you fill find concrete instructions on how and what to change based on your selected recipes and setup.
