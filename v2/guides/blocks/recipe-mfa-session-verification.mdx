In the case of **multi-factor authentication** the MFA claim needs to also be verified.
SuperTokens will automatically add a session claim validator globally. Each time you call `verifySession` the SDK will check if the claim is present and if it has the correct value.
In case you want to exlude certain routes from the claim check or you want to perform this step manually
check the [extensive docs](/docs) on how to do this.
