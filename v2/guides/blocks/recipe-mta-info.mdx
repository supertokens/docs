Multi-tenancy allows you to have one user pool per tenant and different login methods for each tenant.
There are two levels of abstraction when talking about multi-tenancy in **SuperTokens**:

- `Tenant Level`: At this level you can have different user pools and/or databases per tenant. All of these tenants and their users are part of the same application. Users can also be shared across tenants.
- `App Level`: This is the top most level. Here you can define multiple apps that use the same **SuperTokens** core instance. Each app can have its own set of tenants and users.
This is useful when you want to run multiple apps within your organiazation or when you want to create different environments (`dev`, `staging`, `production`) for your apps.
