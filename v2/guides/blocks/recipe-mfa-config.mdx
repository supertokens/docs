In our example app the **Account Linking** recipe is configured so that a user's account gets connected to an authentication method right after the first factor is completed, `shouldAutomaticallyLink: true`.
The second factor gets linked only if the first factor gets verified successfully, `shouldRequireVerification: true`.
For more details on how to customize the **Account Linking** behavior please check our [separate page](/page).

The `MultiFactorAuth` recipe is already configured to use `thirdparty` and `emailpassword` as the first authentication **factors**.
And `TOTP` (Time-based One-time Password) and Email and Phone `OTP` (One-time password) as the second factors.
On the `frontend` we only need to configure the first factors in the recipe initialization process.

Given this setup the authentication flow will work in the following way:
1. The user will see a form where they can either login using a social account or through email and password
2. If the attempt is successful, the user will be directed towards a factor choser screen. Here they can choose between `TOTP` and `OTP`.
3. Based on their selection, we will show the appropriate UI for the factor they chose.

Use the following [guide](/guide) to adjust the configuration based on your needs.
