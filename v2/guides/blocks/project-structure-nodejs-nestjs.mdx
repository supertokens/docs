##### `/auth`

This section can be copy and pasted directly into your existing project without any additional changes. 
In here you will find abstractions for initializing the **SDK**, communicating with the [**SuperTokens Core Service**](/core-service) and common **NestJS** utilities like `guards`, `filters`, `decorators` and `middlewares`.

The middleware file, `auth.middleware.ts`, will include the authentication routes that will enable the login flows to your users.

##### `config.ts`

In here you define a set of constants that describe configurations details on how the authentication flows will work based on your specific use case.
The file includes information on the general app config that you should provide, the [SuperTokens Core Service](/core-service) endpoint, and the [recipes](/recipes) that will be used in your deployment.

You will have to update each variable based on your configuration.
- `connectionURI`: This is the URI of the **SuperTokens Core Service**. Replace the endpoint with the correct one based on your configuration.
- `appInfo`: This is an object that describes your application. Update the `appInfo` section with information specific to your application.
- `recipeList`: This is an array of recipes that you will need to modify with your own configuration values. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections.

##### `app.controller.ts`

Check this file for examples on how to use the guards and decorators exposed by the `/auth` folder. This way you can protect your endpoints and access session specific data.

##### `app.module.ts`

Provides an example of how to import the authentication functionality in your main **NestJS** module.

##### `module.ts`

Includes a `bootstrap` call that configures CORS and sets up an exception filter that will catch any authentication related errors and return proper responses.
