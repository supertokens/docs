The config file exports a series of variables that will be used to initialize the **SuperTokens SDK** and specify which authentication flows to include.
In here you will find examples on how to:

- Setup the the **SuperTokens Core Service** connection. Replace the endpoint with the correct one based on your configuration.
- Specify details about your application. Update the `app_info` section with information specific to your application.
- Describe which authentication **recipes** your app will use. You will have to modify the parameters values with your own configuration values. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections.
- Configure additional functionality like session or user management
