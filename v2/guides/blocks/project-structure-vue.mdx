##### `config.ts`

This file exports two functions:
- `initSuperTokensUI` 
- `initSuperTokensWebJS`, 
In here you will have to adjust the `appInfo` section based on your existing app setup. 
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication [recipe](/recipes). But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

##### `/views/AuthView.vue`

You can copy and paste this file directly into your existing project without any additional changes. It will initialize the authentication UI components.
You can then import the `view` in the main app router by following the example from `/router/index.ts`.

##### `/views/HomeView.vue`

Check this file for examples on how to work with authentication session data.

##### `/main.ts`

This is where we initialize the **SuperTokens SDK**.
