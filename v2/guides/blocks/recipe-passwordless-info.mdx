For `passwordless` authentication you will first have to configure the way in which you want to identify your users.
You can choose between using `EMAIL`, `PHONE` or both, `EMAIL_OR_PHONE`, as the `contactMethod`.
Both the frontend and the backend config files will have to be updated with this.

Besides that, on the backend, you will have to set the authentication flow type.
**SuperTokens** exposes two different types of passwordless authentication: **one time password** and **magic link**.
You will have to set the `flowType` to `MAGIC_LINK`, `USER_INPUT_CODE` or `USER_INPUT_CODE_AND_MAGIC_LINK`, based on your use case.
