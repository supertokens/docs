In our example app we used [try.supertokens.com](https://try.supertokens.com) to host the example app. You can replace the endpoint with your the correct one based on your configuration.

If you want to use our managed service, check this [guide](/guide) on how to sign up and create your environment. 
Otherwise, for self-hosted instances, you can follow either the [Docker](/core-service/docker) guide or the other [instructions](/docker), for non-docker scenarios.
