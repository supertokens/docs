For custom architecture we will need an image without "PHP server". Just say "Your API" or something like that.

![Architecture Schema](/img/other-framework-setup.png)

Let's look at the example above to better understand how everything should be set up.
The diagram shows a simple architecture in which a client frontend communicates, through a reverse proxy, with both the Node.js server 
and your existing backend API. The authentication flow will work in the following way:
1. The **Frontend** will query the `Node.js` server for the authentication routes and it will call those routes to login.
2. The `Node.js server` will use the **Backend SDK** to communicate with the **SuperTokens Core Service** and complete the login attempt. It will then return a session token to the frontend app. 
3. The **Frontend** will store the token and include it in the `Authorization` header of the API calls directed to your existing backend API.
4. Inside your existing server you will have to [verify](/docs/verify) the session using any JWT library of your choice in order to protect your routes.
5. If your existing server returns `401` responses, the **Frontend** will automatically refresh the authentication flow.

To get a more extensive walkthrough on how the SuperTokens Architecture works, please refer to [this page](/docs/architecture).

You can also find out more instructions on how to deploy a separate authentication server in our [extensive guide](/docs/community/other-frameworks).
