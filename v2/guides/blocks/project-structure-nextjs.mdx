Do we include options about the app router version in the initial form?

The command creates a sample Next.js app with authentication configured to work with SuperTokens.
Bellow, we go through the main files that you will need to copy/update based on your setup.

##### `/config`

- `appInfo.ts` 
Includes information about your application. Update it with details specific to your environment.

- `backend.ts`
Exports a function that provides configuration instructions for the [SuperTokens Backend SDK](/backend-sdk).
You will have to update the `supertokens` object with information specific to your account. 
Besides that, in the recipes list, you shuld change the parameters values with your own configuration values. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections.  

- `frontend.tsx`
You can copy and paste this file directly into your existing project without any additional changes. It uses the config values that you defined in the `appInfo.ts` file as well as the authentication
recipes that you have selected.

##### `/api/auth`

This folder includes a file that sets up the authentication endpoints. You can copy it into your existing project without any additional changes.

##### `/api/user`

In here you will find an example of how to expose session related data through an endpoint.

You can notice that each api function makes use of `ensureSuperTokensInit`. This way you can make sure that you are initializing the **SuperTokens Backend SDK** once.   

##### `/auth`

This folder includes a file that will add the authentication routes for the web client. You can copy and paste this file directly into your existing project without any additional changes.
It will include the prebuilt UI components based on the configuration that was set in the `frontend.tsx` file.

##### `layout.tsx`

Here is where you add the `SuperTokensProvider` component over your existing layout. This way we provide the authentication context to all the pages in your app.
The component is defined in the `/components/supertokensProvider.tsx` file. It initializes the **SuperTokens React SDK** and exports the component.

Can this just be a next config plugin?
