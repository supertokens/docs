On the frontend side there are two main aspects that need to be taken into account:

- Telling the `Multitenancy` recipe how to figure out which tenant is active. This can be done through the `getTenantId` function. 
In our example app we store the `tenantId` in `localStorage` and retrieve it each time the function gets called.
You can choose a different storage solution. As long as you return the correct `tenantId` everything will work properly. 
- Exposing the authentication routes based on the `tenantId`. 
The `Auth.tsx` page exports a component that renders an UI for selecting the tenant, if no `tenantId` has been set.
Or the actual login UI, after the user has selected their organization.
