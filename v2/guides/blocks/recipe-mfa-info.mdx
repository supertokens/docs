Before going into the configuration details of this recipe let's first recap on some of the main concepts:
- **Factors** are the different ways in which a user can authenticate. 
- **Claims** are statements made by users about their identity. In the MFA context, we validate a user's `claim` by checking multiple authentication `factors`.
- **Account Linking** is the process of connecting multiple authentication methods to a single user account.
