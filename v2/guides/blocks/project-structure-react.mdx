This folder includes a basic *SPA*, single page app, that uses the [SuperTokens React SDK](/auth-react/modules.html) and a series of prebuilt components to provide an 
authentication UI for users.


##### `config.ts`

This file exports two main constants.
- The `SuperTokensConfig` object that describes the properties that should be used when we initialise the SDK.
- The `PreBuiltUIList`, which includes a series of prebuilt components that will be used in the authentication flows. 
In here you will have to adjust the `getApiDomain` and `getWebsiteDomain` functions based on your existing app setup.  
Besides that you will also have to change the configuration options for each specific authentication recipe. But we will get into more specific on this details in the next sections.

<GuideCondition match="isMtaRecipeVisible">

##### `Auth.tsx`

Given that we are using multi-tenancy, we use the `Auth.tsx` file to allow the user to select a tenant and then expose the correct authentication routes.
Routes are added to our React app, using the `getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom`, after the `tenantId` has been set. 

##### `App.tsx`

Here is where we make use of the previously defined config and we start everything off.
1. The SDK gets initialised based on the configuration that we have previously defined. 
2. The entire app tree is wrapped with the `SuperTokensWrapper` component. This will provide a state context that can be used in our next components.
3. Routes that should be protected by the SDK are wrapped with the `SessionAuth` component

</GuideCondition>
