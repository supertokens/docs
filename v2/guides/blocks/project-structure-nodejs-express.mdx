This folder includes a sample server that exposes the authentication routes.


There are two files included in this project. 

##### `config.ts`

As the name suggests, this file configures the SuperTokens SDK and the features that your instance will use.
In it, you will find examples for the following setup steps:

1. Connecting to the **SuperTokens Core Service**. You will have to replace the endpoint with the correct one based on your configuration and add your `apiKey`.
2. Specifying details about your application. Update the `appInfo` section with information specific to your application. 
3. Selecting and initialising the authentication **recipes** that you need. You will have to modify the parameters values with your own configuration values. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections. 
4. Configuring additional functionality like session or user management


##### `index.ts`

This file initializes a simple Express server that makes use of two functions to expose the auth functionalities:
- `middleware`: This adds the authentication routes to the Express App 
- `errorHandler`: This manages the errors that can be thrown in the authentication flows and includes standardized responses

There are also examples on how to configure CORS, and how to setup two additional endpoints. One for managing session data and one for working with tenants. 

:::important
The order in which each function is called matters. You need to add the CORS config first, then the **SuperTokens** middleware and after that the rest of the
routes that you have in your project.
