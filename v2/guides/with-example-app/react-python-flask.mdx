# Guided Tutorial 
    
The following tutorial will guide you through the process of adding 
authentication features to a **React** applications that uses a **Node.js/Express** backend.

## Architecture Overview

First, let's get a high-level overview of how everything is supposed to work. 

<ArchitectureWithSdk />

## Project Structure

Use our starter project to get up and running quickly. It comes with full config examples 
based on your selection. Just run the following command to install everything:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest some-arguments 
```
The project that you just downloaded is split into two parts:

### `/backend`

<BackendProjectStructure />

### `/frontend`

<FrontendProjectStructure />

## Recipes

Recipes are the building blocks that you can use to enable different authentication functionalities. 
In this section we will talk about specific configuration options and guide you through how to manage
different login scenarios.


<Condition title="Email/Password Authentication" match={selection => selection.recipesVisiblity.emailPassword}>
  

### Email/Password Authentication

You do not have to configure anything in particular for this recipe.
The backend and the frontend code already includes the initialization steps in each config files. 

</Condition>

<Condition title="Social/Enterprise Login" match={selection => selection.recipesVisiblity.thirdparty}>

### Social/Enterprise Login 

The example app includes all the supported third party providers in the config files.
Just remove the ones that you do not want to use.

You will also have to update the credentials for each provider. For more details on how to do this check our [extensive instructions](/guide).

</Condition>

<Condition title="Passwordless Login" match={selection => selection.recipesVisiblity.passwordless}>

### Passwordless Login

For `passwordless` authentication you will first have to configure the way in which you want to identify your users.
You can choose between using `EMAIL`, `PHONE` or both, `EMAIL_OR_PHONE`, as the `contactMethod`.
Both the frontend and the backend config files will have to be updated with this.

Besides that, on the backend, you will have to set the authentication flow type.
**SuperTokens** exposes two different types of passwordless authentication: **one time password** and **magic link**.
You will have to set the `flowType` to `MAGIC_LINK`, `USER_INPUT_CODE` or `USER_INPUT_CODE_AND_MAGIC_LINK`, based on your use case.

</Condition>


## Session Management 

Besides all the authentication recipes that get initialized in the `recipe_list`, you might have noticed another call, `session.init()`.
This enables the session management functionalities that **SuperTokens** provides for your application.

To protect your backend routes, you will have to use the `verify_session` decorator. 
This will check the authentication status before the actual route handler gets called. 
Check the usage `get_session_info` function for a complete example. 

On the frontend we export a `SessionAuth` component that you can use as a wrapper over routes that require authentication.
