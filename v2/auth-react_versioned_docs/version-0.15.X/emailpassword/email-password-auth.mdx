### About

The `EmailPasswordAuth` component is used to wrap any component that requires authentication in an application.

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <EmailPasswordAuth>
                <Dashboard />
            </EmailPasswordAuth>
        );
    }
}
```
- `EmailPasswordAuth` takes a prop called `requireAuth` which if set to `false`, will show the `Dashboard` component even if the user is not logged in.
- `EmailPasswordAuth` also creates a "Session context" which provides the following object to all children components:
   ```tsx
   {
       doesSessionExist: boolean,
       userId: string,
       jwtPayload: any /*JSON object set on the backend*/
   }
   ```
- `EmailPasswordAuth` will update the session, because it uses `SessionAuth` underneath. Read more about session updates in [SessionAuth guide](../session/session-auth).

### Handle session expiry
If you pass a function to `onSessionExpired` prop, it will be called whenever the session expires.

```tsx
const App = () => {
    return (
        <EmailPasswordAuth
            //highlight-next-line
            onSessionExpired={notifyUserAndDisplayPopup}>
            <MyComponent />
        </EmailPasswordAuth>
    )
}
```

:::caution
You will need to redirect the user to the login screen in the callback you provide to `onSessionExpired`.
