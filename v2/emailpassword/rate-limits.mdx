# Rate limit policy

## For managed service

The SuperTokens core is rate limited on a per app and per IP address basis. This means that if query the core for app1 using the same IP address very quickly, the rate limit will kick in and you will get a `429` status code back from the core. However, if you query the core using different IP addresses or for a different app, the rate limit of that won't interfere with the previous requests (that had another IP or was for another app).

:::note
To know more about rps and bursts, please [this nginx document](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/).
:::

## Free tier
The free tier of the managed service has a rate limit of 50 requests per second with a burst of 50 requests per second (with nodelay). This should be enough for 5-10 concurrent sign in / up (each sign in API call queries the SuperTokens core multiple times).

:::important
Our backend SDK auto retries if it gets a `429` status code from the core (up to 5 times before throwing an error).
:::

## Paying users
If you are a paying user for SuperTokens, the rate limit and the burst limit is set dynamically based on your usage (with a minimum of a 100rps). You should not see any `429`s unless there is a **very significant** spike in requests.

If you want higher rate limits, please [email us](mailto:team@supertokens.com), requesting a higher rate limit.

</CustomAdmonition>

## Special case
The `/hello` API exposed by the core is commonly used for health checks. This API does not require any API key, and has it's own rate limit of 5 requests per second per app (regardless of the IP address querying it). This is independent to the rate limit described above, and cannot change.


## For self hosted

The SuperTokens core has no rate limit other than for the `/hello` API (which is 5 requests per second per app). You are free to add rate limits to the core by using [a reverse proxy like Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/).

If you want to implement rate limiting policy similar to our managed service described above, add the following to your `http` and `server` block in the `nginx.conf` file:

```text
http {
    # other configs..
    
    map $request_uri $limit_req_zone_key {
        "~^/(appId|appid)-(\w+)/?" $binary_remote_addr:$2;
        default $binary_remote_addr;
    }

    limit_req_zone $limit_req_zone_key zone=mylimit:10m rate50/s;
    limit_req_status 429;

    # other configs..

    upstream supertokens {
        server localhost:3567;
    }

    server {
        limit_req zone=mylimit burst=50 nodelay;

        # other configs..

        listen 0.0.0.0:80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://supertokens;
        }
    }
}
```

In the above, we add rate limit per app per IP address to the core.
