<TabItem value="mobile">

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain showMultiTenancyTab>

Call the follwing API when the user clicks on the sign up button (the command below can be tried on your terminal).

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/signup' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "formFields": [{
        "id": "email",
        "value": "john@example.com"
    }, {
        "id": "password",
        "value": "somePassword123"
    }]
}'
```

</AppInfoForm>

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User creation was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID.
- `status: "FIELD_ERROR"`: One of the form field inputs failed validation. The response body contains information about which form field input based on the `id`:
    - The email could fail validation if it's syntactically not an email, of it it's not unique.
    - The password could fail validation if it's not string enough (as defined by the backend password validator).

    Either way, you want to show the user an error next to the input form field.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overriden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during MFA. The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign up was not allowed.

</TabItem>

</FrontendCustomUITabs>

The `formFields` input is a key-value array. You must provide it an `email` and a `password` value at a minimum. If you want to provide additional items, for example the user's name or age, you can append it to the array like so:

```json
{
    "formFields": [{
        "id": "email",
        "value": "john@example.com"
    }, {
        "id": "password",
        "value": "somePassword123"
    }, {
        "id": "name",
        "value": "John Doe"
    }]
}
```

On the backend, the `formFields` array will be available to you for consumption.

:::note
On success, the backend will send back session tokens as part of the response headers which will be automatically handled by our frontend SDK for you.

### Checking if email is unique

As a part of the sign up form, you may want to explicitly check that the entered email is unique. Whilst this is already done via the sign up API call, it may be a better UX to warn the user about a non unique email right after they finish typing it.

        });

        if (response.doesExist) {
            window.alert("Email already exists. Please sign in instead")

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: The response will also contain a `exists` boolean which will be `true` if the input email already belongs to an email password user.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overriden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should be displayed on the frontend.
