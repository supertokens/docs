This guide explains how to migrate users from an external authentication providers like `Auth0` to SuperTokens.

Migration involves two main steps:

- Account Migration
- Session Migration

## Step 1) Account Migration:

In the first step, use the Bulk User Import API to create a SuperTokens user for each user in your existing authentication provider. This API allows you to:

- Create a SuperTokens user.
- Map the existing userId to the SuperTokens userId.
- Mark the email as verified (if applicable).
- Add roles, metadata, and MFA devices (if applicable).
- Link multiple login methods for the same user (if applicable).

For implementation details, refer to the [Bulk User Import](./bulk-user-import) section.

## Step 2) Session Migration

If users have active sessions, use [this guide](./session-migration) to migrate their external provider sessions to SuperTokens sessions. This way, users won't need to re-authenticate.

Learn how to implement session migration in the [Session Migration](./session-migration) section.
