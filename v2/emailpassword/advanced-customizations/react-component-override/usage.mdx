# How to use

1. You will need to modify the `EmailPassword.init(...)` function call.
2. Component overrides can be configured at `override.components` config object.
3. [Pick a component](#finding-which-component-will-be-overridden) that you'd like to override by its key.
4. Supply a React component against the key you have picked. Your custom component will get the original component as a `prop`.

## Example
<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { SuperTokensWrapper } from "supertokens-auth-react";
import { EmailPasswordComponentsOverrideProvider } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";

function App() {
    return (
        <SuperTokensWrapper>
            <EmailPasswordComponentsOverrideProvider
                components={{
                    // In this case, the <EmailPasswordSignIn_Override> 
                    // will render the original component
                    // wrapped in a div with an octocat picture above it.
                    EmailPasswordSignIn_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                        return (
                            <div>
                                <img src="octocat.jpg" />
                                <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                            </div>
                        );
                    },
                }}>
                {/* Rest of the JSX */}
            </EmailPasswordComponentsOverrideProvider>
        </SuperTokensWrapper>
    );
}
export default App;

```

<img alt="Prebuilt sign in UI with custom image" src="/img/emailpassword/react-override-octocat.png" />

:::important
Please make sure that the file in which this config is specified is a `.tsx` or ` .jsx` file type.

</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

## Finding which component will be overridden
To do that, you should use React Developer Tools extension which provides a component tree inspector.

### Example
<img alt="Checking which component from the prebuilt UI will be overridden using React Developer Tools extension" src="/img/emailpassword/override/find-component.png" />

1. Look for the names defined in component override config and/or components ending in `_Override` in the component tree.
2. Ensure that's the component you want to override
3. Overide the component as stated above.

## How do I render the original component
Because the override function receives the original component as a parameter,
you can render it. To do this, simply use it in JSX. Don't forget to supply original props
by spreading them.

```tsx
import React from "react";

const customComponent = ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }: { DefaultComponent: React.ComponentType }) => {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>I'm a header that you added above original component</h1>
            <DefaultComponent {...props} />
        </>
    )
}
```
