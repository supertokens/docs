# Redirection Callback Hook

<PreBuiltOrCustomUISwitcher>
<PreBuiltUIContent>

This function is used to change where the user is redirected to post certain actions. For example, you can use this to redirect a user to a specific URL post sign in / up. If you're embedding the sign in / up components in a popup and wish to disable redirection entirely, simply return `null`.

Not applicable since you need to build custom UI anyway, so you can redirect the user after calling our SDK functions / API.
