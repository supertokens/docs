# Redirection Callback Hook

This function is used to change where the user is redirected to post certain actions. For example, you can use this to redirect a user to a specific URL post sign in / up. If you're embedding the sign in / up components in a popup and wish to disable redirection entirely, simply return `null`.

import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";
