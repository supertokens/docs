# Manually verify the JWT

There are three steps in doing session verification using JWTs:
- Verify the JWT signature and expiry using a JWT verification library
- Check for custom claim values for authorization.
- Preventing CSRF attacks in case you are using cookies to store the JWT.

## Verifying a JWT using a jwt verification library

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain>

### Method 1) Using JWKS endpoint (recommended)

<BackendSDKTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true} enableJava={true}>
<TabItem value="nodejs">


Some libraries let you provide a JWKS endpoint to verify a JWT. The JWKS endpoint exposed by SuperTokens is available at the following URL:

```bash
curl --location --request GET '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'
```

Below is an example for NodeJS showing how you can use `jsonwebtoken` and `jwks-rsa` together to achieve JWT verification using the `jwks.json` endpoint.

```ts
import JsonWebToken, { JwtHeader, SigningKeyCallback } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';

var client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'
});

function getKey(header: JwtHeader, callback: SigningKeyCallback) {
  client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function (err, key) {
    var signingKey = key!.getPublicKey();
    callback(err, signingKey);
  });
}

let jwt = "..."; // fetch the JWT from sAccessToken cookie or Authorization Bearer header
JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, getKey, {}, function (err, decoded) {
  let decodedJWT = decoded;
  // Use JWT
});
```

Refer to this [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/rishabhpoddar/ea31502923ec9a53136371f2b6317ffa) for a code reference of how use `PyJWK` to do session verification. The gist contains two files:
- `jwt_verification.py` (which you can just copy / paste into your application). You will have to modify the `JWKS_URI` in this file to point to your supertokens core instance (replacing the `try.supertokens.com` part of the URL). This file is written for `sync` python apps, and can be modified to work with `async` apps as well.
  - This file essentially exposes a function called `verify_jwt` which takes an input JWT string.
  - This function takes care of caching public keys in memory + auto refetching if the public keys have changed (which happens automatically every 24 hours with supertokens). This will not cause any user logouts, and is just a security feature.
- `views.py`: This is an example `GET` API which extracts the JWT token from the authorization header in the request and calls the `verify_jwt` function from the other file. If you are using cookie based auth instead of header based auth, you should read the JWT from the `sAccessToken` cookie in the request.

- `verifyToken.go` (which you can just copy / paste into your application). You will have to modify the `coreUrl` in this file to point to your supertokens core instance (replacing the `try.supertokens.com` part of the URL).
  - This file essentially exposes a function called `GetJWKS` which returns a reference to the JWKS public keys that can be used for JWT verification.

### Method 2) Using public key string

<BackendSDKTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true} enableJava={true}>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

:::caution
This method is less secure compared to Method 1 because it disables key rotation of the access token signing key. In this case, if the private key is stolen somehow, it can be used indinitely to forge access tokens (Unless you manually change the key in the database).
:::

Some JWT verification libraries require you to provide the JWT secret / public key for verification. You can obtain the JWT secret from SuperTokens in the following way:

- First, we query the `JWKS.json` endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl --location --request GET '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'

  {
    "keys": [
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "kid": "s-2de612a5-a5ba-413e-9216-4c43e2e78c86",
        "n": "AMZruthvYz7Ft-Dp0BC_SEEJaWK91s_YA-RR81iLJ6BTT6gJp0CcV4DfBynFU_59dRGOZyVQpAW6Drnc_6LyZpVWHROzqt-Fjh8TAqodayhPJVuZt25eQiYrqcaK_dnuHrm8qwUq-hko6q1o1o9NIIZWNfUBEVWmNhyAJFk5bi3pLwtKPYrUQzVLcTdDUe4SIltvvfpYHbVFnYtxkBVmqO68j7sI8ktmTXM_heals-W6WmozabDkC9_ITCeRat2f7A2l0t4QzO0ZCzZcJfhusF4X1niKgY6yYXpbX6is4HCfhYfdabcE52xYMNl-gw9XDjsIxfBMUDvOFRHWlx0rU8c=",
        "e": "AQAB",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "use": "sig"
      },
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "kid": "d-230...802340",
        "n": "AMZruthvYz7...lx0rU8c=",
        "e": "...",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "use": "sig"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  :::important
  The above shows an example output which returns two keys. There could be more keys returned based on the configured key rotation setting in the core. If you notice, each key's `kid` starts with a `s-..` or a `d-..`. The `s-..` key is a static key that will never change, whereas `d-...` keys are dynamic keys that keep changing. So if you are hardcoding public keys somewhere, you always want to pick the `s-..` key.

  One exception is that if you see a key with `kid` that doesn't start with `s-` or with `d-`, then you should treat that as a static key (This will only happen if you used to run an older SuperTokens core that was lesser than version `5.0`).
  :::

- Next, we run the NodeJS script below to convert the above output to a `PEM` file format.
  ```tsx
  import jwkToPem from 'jwk-to-pem';

  // This JWK is copied from the result of the above SuperTokens core request
  let jwk = {
    "kty": "RSA",
    "kid": "s-2de612a5-a5ba-413e-9216-4c43e2e78c86",
    "n": "AMZruthvYz7Ft-Dp0BC_SEEJaWK91s_YA-RR81iLJ6BTT6gJp0CcV4DfBynFU_59dRGOZyVQpAW6Drnc_6LyZpVWHROzqt-Fjh8TAqodayhPJVuZt25eQiYrqcaK_dnuHrm8qwUq-hko6q1o1o9NIIZWNfUBEVWmNhyAJFk5bi3pLwtKPYrUQzVLcTdDUe4SIltvvfpYHbVFnYtxkBVmqO68j7sI8ktmTXM_heals-W6WmozabDkC9_ITCeRat2f7A2l0t4QzO0ZCzZcJfhusF4X1niKgY6yYXpbX6is4HCfhYfdabcE52xYMNl-gw9XDjsIxfBMUDvOFRHWlx0rU8c=",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "use": "sig"
  };

  // @ts-ignore
  let certString = jwkToPem(jwk);
  ```

  The above snippet would generate the following certificate string:

  ```text
  -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxmu62G9jPsW34OnQEL9I
  QQlpYr3Wz9gD5FHzWIsnoFNPqAmnQJxXgN8HKcVT/n11EY5nJVCkBboOudz/ovJm
  ... (truncated for display)
  XhfWeIqBjrJheltfqKzgcJ+Fh91ptwTnbFgw2X6DD1cOOwjF8ExQO84VEdaXHStT
  xwIDAQAB
  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  ```

- Now you can use the generated PEM string in your code like shown below:

  ```ts
  import JsonWebToken from 'jsonwebtoken';

  // Truncated for display
  let certificate = "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhki...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----";
  let jwt = "..."; // fetch the JWT from sAccessToken cookie or Authorization Bearer header
  JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, certificate, function (err, decoded) {
      let decodedJWT = decoded;
      // Use JWT
  });
  ```

- The final step is to tell SuperTokens to always only use the static key when creating a new session. This can be done by setting the below config in the backend SDK:

  ```tsx
  import SuperTokens from "supertokens-node";
  import Session from "supertokens-node/recipe/session";

  SuperTokens.init({
      supertokens: {
          connectionURI: "...",
      },
      appInfo: {
          apiDomain: "...",
          appName: "...",
          websiteDomain: "..."
      },
      recipeList: [
          Session.init({
              //highlight-next-line
              useDynamicAccessTokenSigningKey: false,
          })
      ]
  });
  ```

:::caution
Updating this value will cause a spike in the session refresh API, as and when users visit your application.

## Check for custom claim values for authorization

<BackendSDKTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true} enableJava={true}>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

Once you have verified the access token, you can fetch the payload and do authorization checks based on the values of the custom claims. For examlpe, if you want to do check for if the user's email is verified, you should check the `st-ev` claim in the payload as shown below:

```ts
import JsonWebToken, { JwtHeader, SigningKeyCallback } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';

var client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: '^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'
});

function getKey(header: JwtHeader, callback: SigningKeyCallback) {
  client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function (err, key) {
    var signingKey = key!.getPublicKey();
    callback(err, signingKey);
  });
}

let jwt = "..."; // fetch the JWT from sAccessToken cookie or Authorization Bearer header
JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, getKey, {}, function (err, decoded) {
  if (err) {
    // send a 401 to the frontend..
  }
  if (decoded !== undefined && typeof decoded !== "string") {
    let isEmailVerified = (decoded as any)["st-ev"].v
    if (!isEmailVerified) {
      // send a 403 to the frontend..
    }
  }
});
```

Claims like email verification and user roles claims are added to the access token by our backend SDK automatically. You can even [add your own custom claims](../claims/access-token-payload) to the access token payload and those claims will be in the JWT as expected.

:::important
On claim validation failure, you must send a `403` to the frontend which will cause our frontend SDK (pre built UI SDK) to recheck the claims added on the frontend and navigate to the right screen.

## Check for anti-csrf during authorization

:::important
You will need to check for anti-csrf for **NON** GET requests when cookie based authentication is enabled.
::: 

There are two methods for configuring [CSRF protection](../anti-csrf):
- `VIA_CUSTOM_HEADER`
- `VIA_TOKEN`

### Checking for anti-csrf when `VIA_CUSTOM_HEADER` is set
`VIA_CUSTOM_HEADER` is automatically set if `sameSite` is `none` or if your `apiDomain` and `websiteDomain` do not share the same top level domain. In this case you will need to check for the presence of the `rid` header from incoming requests.

### Checking for anti-csrf when `VIA_TOKEN` is set
When configured with `VIA_TOKEN`, an explicit `anti-csrf` token will be attached as a header to requests with `anti-csrf` as the key. To verify the `anti-csrf` token you will need to compare it the to value of the `antiCsrfToken` key from the payload of the decoded JWT.
