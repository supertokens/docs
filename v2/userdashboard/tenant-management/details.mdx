# Tenant details

Upon selection or creation of a tenant, you will be presented with the Tenant Details page. The various sections are explained below.

## Tenant ID and users

<img src="/img/dashboard/tenant-management/tenant-users.png" alt="Tenant users"/>

The first section shows up the tenant ID and the number of users in that tenant. Clicking on `See Users` takes you to the [user management page](/docs/userdashboard/users-listing-and-details) where the users for the selected tenant can be viewed and managed.


## Enabled Login Methods

<img src="/img/dashboard/tenant-management/login-methods.png" alt="Login Methods"/>

This section displays the various login methods available for the tenant. By enabling these toggles, you can make the corresponding login methods accessible to the users within the tenant.

Appropriate recipes must be enabled to be able to turn on the login methods. For example, 

- to be able to turn on `emailpassword`, EmailPassword recipe must be initialised in the backend.
- to be able to turn on `OTP Phone`, Passwordless recipe must be initialised with flowType `USER_INPUT_CODE` and contactMethod `PHONE`

:::info

If you are using our Auth React SDK, make sure to enable [usesDynamicLoginMethods](/docs/passwordless/common-customizations/multi-tenancy/common-domain-login#step-3-tell-supertokens-about-the-saved-tenantid-from-the-previous-step) so that the frontend can automatically show the login methods based on the selection here.

## Secondary factors

<img src="/img/dashboard/tenant-management/secondary-factors.png" alt="Secondary Factors"/>

This section displays the various secondary factors available for the tenant. By enabling these toggles, the corresponding factor will be enabled for all users of the tenant. Refer [Multifactor Authentication docs](/docs/mfa/introduction) for more information.

[MultiFactorAuth](/docs/mfa/backend-setup) recipe must be initialised to be able to enable Secondary Factors.

Also, appropriate recipes must be initialised in the backend SDK to be able to use a secondary factor. For example,

- to be able to turn on TOTP, TOTP recipe must be initialised in the backend.
- to be able to turn on `OTP Phone`, Passwordless recipe must be initialised with flowType `USER_INPUT_CODE` and contactMethod `PHONE`

## Core config

<img src="/img/dashboard/tenant-management/core-config.png" alt="Core Config"/>

This section shows the current config values in core for the tenant. You can edit some of these settings by clicking the `pencil` icon next to the property.

:::caution

Some of the config values may not be editable since they are being inherited from the App. If using Supertokens managed hosting, they can be modified in the SaaS Dashboard. Else, if you are self-hosting the SuperTokens core, they will have to be edited via Docker env variables or the config.yaml file.
