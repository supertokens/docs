# How to use the user management dashboard

With the user management dashboard, you can view the list of users on SuperTokens and be able to easily view, modify or delete their sessions, metadata, roles and account info.

## Complete quick setup

Before you can use the user management dashboard make sure to complete setting up SuperTokens on your backend by following the quick setup guide for the recipe of your choice, view all recipes [here](/docs/guides)

import BackendSDKTabs from "/src/components/tabs/BackendSDKTabs";
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import AppInfoForm from "/src/components/appInfoForm"

## Initialise the dashboard recipe

<AppInfoForm askForAPIDomain>

To get started, initialise the Dashboard recipe in the `recipeList`.

<BackendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-node";
import Dashboard from "supertokens-node/recipe/dashboard";

SuperTokens.init({
  appInfo: {
    apiDomain: "...",
    appName: "...",
    websiteDomain: "...",
  },
  recipeList: [
    // TODO: Initialise other recipes
    // highlight-start
    Dashboard.init(),
    // highlight-end
  ],
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go">

```go
import (
	"github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/recipe/dashboard"
	"github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/supertokens"
)

func main() {
  supertokens.Init(supertokens.TypeInput{
      RecipeList: []supertokens.Recipe{
        // TODO: Initialise other recipes
        // highlight-start
        dashboard.Init(nil),
        // highlight-end
      },
  });
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
from supertokens_python import init, InputAppInfo
from supertokens_python.recipe import dashboard

init(
    app_info=InputAppInfo(
        api_domain="...", app_name="...", website_domain="..."),
    framework='...',  # type: ignore
    recipe_list=[
        # TODO: Initialise other recipes
        # highlight-start
        dashboard.init(),
        # highlight-end
    ]
)
```

</TabItem>
</BackendSDKTabs>

## Viewing the dashboard

:::important
The user management dashboard is served by the backend SDK, you have to use your API domain when trying to visit the dashboard.
:::

Navigate to `^{form_apiDomain}^{form_apiBasePath}/dashboard` to view the dashboard.

## Creating dashboard credentials

:::tip Paid Feature
You can create one dashboard user* for free. If you need to create additional users please email us at team@supertokens.com.

*: A dashboard user is a user that can log into and view the user management dashboard. These users are independent to the users of your application
:::

When you first setup SuperTokens, there are no credentials created for the dashboard. If you click the "Add a new user" button in the dashboard login screen you can see the command you need to execute in order to create credentials.

<img src="/img/dashboard/signup.png" alt="Dashboard login screen" />

To create credentials you need to make a request to SuperTokens core. 

- The example above uses the demo core `https://try.supertokens.com`, replace this with the connection uri you pass to the backend SDK when initialising SuperTokens.
- Replace `<YOUR-API-KEY>` with your API key. If you are using a self hosted SuperTokens core there is no API key by default. In that case you can either skip or ignore the `api-key` header.
- Replace `<YOUR_EMAIL>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` with the appropriate values

## Updating dashboard credentials

You can update the email or password of existing credentials by using the "Forgot Password" button on the dashboard login page.

<img src="/img/dashboard/forgot-password.png" alt="Dashboard login screen" />

To update credentials you need to make a request to SuperTokens core. 

- The example above uses the demo core `https://try.supertokens.com`, replace this with the connection uri you pass to the backend SDK when initialising SuperTokens.
- Replace `<YOUR-API-KEY>` with your API key. If you are using a self hosted SuperTokens core there is no API key by default. In that case you can either skip or ignore the `api-key` header.
- Replace `<YOUR_EMAIL>` and `<YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD>` with the appropriate values. You can use `newEmail` instead of `newPassword` if you want to update the email

## Viewing users

If you have just created your app, you may not have any users to show on the dashboard.

<img src="/img/dashboard/no-users.png" alt="Empty dashboard" />

Navigate to the your frontend app and create a user (via the sign up flow). On creation, if you head back to the dashboard and refresh the page, you will see that user:

<img src="/img/dashboard/one-user.png" alt="One user in dashboard" />

</AppInfoForm>

## User Management

When you select a user you can view detailed information about the user such as email, phone number, user metadata etc.

<img src="/img/dashboard/user-info.png" alt="One user in dashboard" />

<img src="/img/dashboard/user-info-continued.png" alt="One user in dashboard" />

You can edit user information and perform actions such as resetting a user's password or revoke sessions for a user.

:::important Note
Some features such as user metadata and email verification have to be enabled in your backend before you can use them in the user management dashboard
:::

## Content Security Policy

If you return a `Content-Security-Policy` header in from your backend, you will need to include the following directives for the user management dashboard to work correctly

script-src:
  'self' 
  'unsafe-inline'
