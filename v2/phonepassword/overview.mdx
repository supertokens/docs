# Customisation overiview

We can achieve this type of login by combining and customising the other recipes provided by SuperTokens:
- **EmailPassword recipe**: We will customise this recipe to accept a phone number instead of an email.
- **Passwordless recipe**: We will use this recipe to create and send the phone OTP for phone number verfication, as the second step in the login / sign up process.
- **Session recipe**: This will provide us with session management. It will also be used to make sure that the user can access the protected frontend and backend routes only after going through both the login challenges (entered the right password and verified the mobile number via an OTP).

We will use [a demo app](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-phone-password) written in ReactJS and NodeJS as a reference. So all the code snippets in this guide will be for these two frameworks.
