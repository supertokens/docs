# About

## Overview steps

Integrating SuperTokens with a Next.js app involves:
- Calling the frontend and backend init functions
- Adding a website page to display the auth related widgets (on `/auth` by default)
- Creating a serverless function to expose the auth related APIs which will be consumed by the frontend widgets (on `/api/auth/` by default)
- Protecting website routes: Displaying them only when a user is logged in, else redirecting them to the login page
- Performing session verification:
    - In your APIs
    - In `getServerSideProps`

Each of these will be covered in the next few pages. Rest of the customizations can be done by following the "Common customizations" section.

## An example repo
[See the GitHub repo](https://github.com/supertokens/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-supertokens) or start a new project using:
```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-supertokens with-supertokens-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-supertokens with-supertokens-app
```

:::note
This example uses the ThirdPartyEmailPassword recipe. If you want to use another recipe, you can still use this as a starting point and change the configurations.
