## Setting up the core and database
<Question
    question={() => {
        return (
            <span>Are you using <code>https://try.supertokens.com</code> as the connection URI in the init function?</span>
        )
    }}>
<Answer title="Yes">

You need to now setup an instance of the SuperTokens core for your app (that your backend should connect to). You have two options:
- [Managed service](../quick-setup/core/saas-setup)
- Self hosted with your own database ([With Docker](../quick-setup/core/with-docker) or [Without Docker](../quick-setup/core/without-docker))
