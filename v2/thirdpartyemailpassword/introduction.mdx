## Demo application

- See our [live demo app](https://^{docsLinkRecipeName}.demo.supertokens.com/).
- We have a read-only user management dashboard (with fake data), and it can be accessed [on this link](https://dashboard.demo.supertokens.com/api/auth/dashboard). The credentials for logging in are:
    ```text
    email: demo@supertokens.com
    password: abcd1234
    ```
- Generate a starter app
    ```bash
    npx create-supertokens-app@latest --recipe=^{docsLinkRecipeName}
    ```
- The user management dashboard for the starter app can be accessed on `http://localhost:3001/auth/dashboard`. You will have to first create users (instrs are on the dashboard UI), before logging in.
