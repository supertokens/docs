# Method 1) Default service

If you provide no configuration for email delivery, the backend SDK sends emails by talking to our servers on `https://api.supertokens.com` (for both self hosted and managed versions). This requires no setup from your side and can be used in production.

You can see the default email UI here:
- Default [email verification template](../common-customizations/email-verification/email-verification-email) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/email-verification.html).
- Default [password reset template](../common-customizations/reset-password/password-reset-email) and its [source code](https://github.com/supertokens/email-sms-templates/blob/master/email-html/password-reset.html).

:::important
- We do not log / store any of the info sent to our API that send out emails on behalf of your app.
- Emails are sent using `no-reply@supertokens.com` email ID. If you want to use your own domain, please see one of the other methods in this section.
- You cannot customise the email template when using this method. If you want to customise the emails, please see one of the other methods in this section.
