# Adding Email Password Login

## Sign up flow

<PreBuiltUITabs>

<TabItem value="reactjs">

SuperTokens provides a ready to use form for sign up. 

By default SuperTokens renders this on the `/auth` route, you can change this by providing a value for `websiteBasePath` [when calling the `init` function](../quick-setup/frontend#2-call-the-init-function)

<img width="600px" alt="Email password sign up" src="/img/thirdpartyemailpassword/signup-light.png" />

When the user enters their email and password and clicks the "Sign Up" button, the SDK calls the [/signup](https://supertokens.com/docs/fdi#/ThirdPartyEmailPassword%20Recipe/thirdPartyEmailPasswordsignUp) API that is added by the [middleware](../quick-setup/backend#4-add-the-supertokens-apis--cors-setup) provided by the SuperTokens backend SDK.

When `/signup` succeeds, the session tokens are set to cookies. Every network request that requires auth then relies on these tokens to verify that a session exists.

:::info Styling
You can change the way the SuperTokens form looks, to know more refer to the [Styling section](../common-customizations/styling/changing-colours.mdx)
:::

:::info Language Translation
SuperTokens supports multiple languages, to learn how to use your own language for the form refer to the [Language Translation Section](../common-customizations/translations.mdx)

After collecting user information, you can call the [`emailPasswordSignUp`](https://supertokens.com/docs/web-js/modules/recipe_thirdpartyemailpassword.html#emailPasswordSignUp-1) function:

```tsx
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

async function signup(email: string, password: string) {
    const signUpResponse = await ThirdPartyEmailPassword.emailPasswordSignUp({
        formFields: [
            {
                id: "email",
                value: email,
            },
            {
                id: "password",
                value: password,
            }
        ],
    });

    if (signUpResponse.status === "OK") {
        // Success, you can access the user information
        const user = signUpResponse.user;
    }

    // Error handling
    if (signUpResponse.status === "FIELD_ERROR") {
        // Iterate through form fields to identify the error
        signUpResponse.formFields.forEach(field => {
            // The id will match the values you passed when calling signUp
            console.log("Error in field with id:", field.id)
            console.log(field.error);
        })
    }
}
```

When calling the `emailPasswordSignUp`, `formFields` is used to send email and password information to the backend. The server may respond with a `{status: "FIELD_ERROR"}`, this means that one of the fields provided in `formFields` is invalid. For example if you call `emailPasswordSignUp` with an email that already exists, the server will respond to something similar to:

```jsx
{"status":"FIELD_ERROR","formFields":[{"id":"email","error":"This email already exists. Please sign in instead."}]}
```

In this case you can iterate the `formFields` object in the response to identify the exact error as indicated in the code snippet above.

The server responds with `{status: "OK"}` if it is successful. The session tokens are added to cookies, network requests that require auth rely on these tokens to verify that a session exists.

    }

    if (signUpResponse.status === "WRONG_CREDENTIALS_ERROR") {
        // Invalid credentials entered
    }

```

When calling the `emailPasswordSignIn`, `formFields` is used to send email and password information to the backend. The server may respond with a `{"status": "FIELD_ERROR"}`, this means that one of the fields provided as part of `formFields` did not pass validation on the backend. You can iterate the `formFields` object in the response to identify the exact error as indicated in the code snippet above.

If the email and password combination is not valid the server responds with `{"status":"WRONG_CREDENTIALS_ERROR"}`

The server responds with `{"status": "OK"}` if it is successful. The session tokens are added to cookies, network requests that require auth rely on these tokens to verify that a session exists.
