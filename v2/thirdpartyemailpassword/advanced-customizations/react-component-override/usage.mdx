# How to use

1. You will need to modify the `ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init(...)` function call.
2. Component overrides can be configured at `override.components` config object.
3. [Pick a component](#finding-which-component-will-be-overridden) that you'd like to override by its key.
4. Supply a React component against the key you have picked. Your custom component will get the original component as a `prop`.

## Example
<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
    override: {
        components: {
            EmailPasswordSignInHeader_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                /**
                * In this case, the <EmailPasswordSignInHeader_Override> will render the original component
                * wrapped in a div with an octocat picture above it.
                */
                return (
                    <div>
                        <img src="octocat.jpg" />
                        <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                    </div>
                );
            },
        },
        emailVerification: {
            components: {
                // Please refer to overriding email verification components below
            }
        }
    }
});
```

<img alt="Prebuilt sign in UI with custom image" src="/img/thirdpartyemailpassword/react-override-octocat.png" />

:::important
Please make sure that the file in which this config is specified is a `.tsx` or ` .jsx` file type.

## Finding which component will be overridden
To do that, you should use React Developer Tools extension which provides a component tree inspector.

### Example
<img alt="Checking which component from the prebuilt UI will be overridden using React Developer Tools extension" src="/img/thirdpartyemailpassword/override/find-component.png" />

1. Look for the names defined in component override config and/or components ending in `_Override` in the component tree.
2. Ensure that's the component you want to override
3. Overide the component as stated above.

## How do I render the original component
Because the override function receives the original component as a parameter,
you can render it. To do this, simply use it in JSX. Don't forget to supply original props
by spreading them.

```tsx
import React from "react";

const customComponent = ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }: { DefaultComponent: React.ComponentType }) => {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>I'm a header that you added above original component</h1>
            <DefaultComponent {...props} />
        </>
    )
}
```

## Overriding email verification components
You can also override components related to email verification.
To do that, nest the override configuration like:

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

ThirdPartyEmailPassword.init({
    // notice that we are passing the components
    // object inside the emailVerification object
    override: {
        emailVerification: {
            components: {
                EmailVerificationSendVerifyEmail_Override: ({ DefaultComponent, ...props }) => {
                    return (
                        <div>
                            <DefaultComponent {...props} />
                        </div>
                    );
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>
