# About appInfo

The `appInfo` object is to be specified on the frontend as well as on the backend.

:::important
Use environment variables to determine the values of `websiteDomain`, `apiDomain`...etc.
:::

## `appName` (compulsory)
This is the name of your application. It is used when sending password reset or email verification emails (in the default email design). An example of this is `appName: "GitHub"`.

------------

## `websiteDomain` (compulsory)

This is the domain part of your website. This is where the login UI will be shown. For example:
- For local development, you are likely using `localhost` with some port (ex `8080`). Then the value of this should be `"http://localhost:8080"`.
- If your website is `https://www.example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://www.example.com"`.
- If your website is `https://example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://example.com"`.
- If you have multiple sub domains, and your users login via `https://auth.example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://auth.example.com"`.

By default, the login UI will be displayed on `{websiteDomain}/auth/*`. This can be changed by using the `websiteBasePath` config.

On the frontend, we need the domain for routing purposes, and on the backend, we need it so that we can generate correct email verification and password reset links.

------------

## `apiDomain` (compulsory)

This is the domain part of your API endpoint that the frontend talks to. For example:
- For local development, you are likely using `localhost` with some port (ex `9000`). Then the value of this should be `"http://localhost:9000"`.
- If your frontend queries `https://api.example.com/*`, then the value of this should be `"https://api.example.com"`
- If your API endpoint is reached via `/api/*`, then the value of this is the same as the `websiteDomain` - since `/api/*` is equal to querying `{websiteDomain}/api/*`.

By default, our login widgets will query `{apiDomain}/auth/*`. This can be changed by using the `apiBasePath` config.

------------

## `websiteBasePath` (optional)

By default, the login UI will be displayed on `{websiteDomain}/auth`. Other auth related UIs will be shown on `{websiteDomain}/auth/*`.

If you want to change the `/auth` to something else, then you must set this value. For example:
- If you want the login UI to show on `{websiteDomain}/user/*`, then the value of this should be `"/user"`.
- If you are using a dedicated sub domain for auth, like `https://auth.example.com`, then you probably want the login UI to show up on `https://auth.example.com`. In this case, set this value to `"/"`.

:::important
Remember to set the same value for this param on the backend and the frontend.
:::

------------

## `apiBasePath` (optional)

By default, our frontend SDK will query `{apiDomain}/auth/*`.

If you want to change the `/auth` to something else, then you must set this value. For example:
- If you have versioning in your API path and want to query `{apiDomain}/v0/auth/*`, then the value of this should be `"/v0/auth"`.
- If you want to scope our APIs not via `/auth` but via some other string like `/supertokens`, then you can set the value of this to `"/supertokens"`. This means, our APIs will be exposed on `{apiDomain}/supertokens/*`.
- If you do not want to scope our APIs at all, then you can set the values of this to be `"/"`. This means our APIs will be available on `{apiDomain}/*`

:::important
Remember to set the same value for this param on the backend and the frontend.

## `apiGatewayPath` (optional)

:::note
Most relevant if you are using an API gateway or reverse proxy
:::

If you are using an API gateway (like the one provided by AWS) or a reverse proxy (like Nginx), it may add a path to your API endpoints to scope them for different development environments. For example, your APIs for development would be exposed via `{apiDomain}/dev/*`, and for production, they may be exposed via `{apiDomain}/prod/*`.

Whilst the frontend would need to use the `/dev/` and `/prod/`, your backend code would not see that sub path (i.e. `/dev/` and `/prod/` are stripped away by the gateway). 

For these situations, you should set the `apiGatewayPath` to `/dev` or `/prod`. For example:
- If your API gateway is using `/development` for scoping, and you want to expose the SuperTokens APIs on `/supertokens/*`, then set `apiGatewayPath: "/development"` & `apiBasePath: "/supertokens"`. This means that our frontend SDK will query `{apiDomain}/development/supertokens/*` to reach the endpoints exposed by us.
- If you set this and not `apiBasePath`, then the frontend SDK will query `{apiDomain}{apiGatewayPath}/auth/*` to reach the endpoints exposed by us.

The reason we have this distinction between `apiGatewayPath` and `apiBasePath` is that when routing, our backend SDK will not see the `apiGatewayPath` path from the request as they are stripped away by the gateway. Taking the above example, whilst the frontend queries `{apiDomain}/development/supertokens/*`, our backend SDK will see `{apiDomain}/supertokens/*`.
