You'll need to integrate the login UI into `root.tsx` to allow for authentication when visiting protected routes.

Add the following sample code into `root.tsx`:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
import {
  Meta,
  Links,
  Scripts,
  LiveReload,
  Outlet,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";
import SuperTokens, { SuperTokensWrapper } from "supertokens-auth-react";
import { frontendConfig } from "./config/frontend";
import { SessionAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session/index.js";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import type { LinksFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import appStylesHref from "./app.css";
export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: appStylesHref },
];

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  SuperTokens.init(frontendConfig());
}

export default function App() {
  const location = useLocation();
  const isUnprotectedRoute = location.pathname.startsWith("/auth");

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body className="app-wrapper">
        <SuperTokensWrapper>
          {isUnprotectedRoute ? (
            <Outlet />
          ) : (
            <SessionAuth>
              <Outlet />
            </SessionAuth>
          )}

          <ScrollRestoration />
          <Scripts />
          <LiveReload />
        </SuperTokensWrapper>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Let's review the code:

- The component initializes SuperTokens with frontend configuration settings and determines whether the current route requires authentication based on the pathname.
- If the route is unprotected, it directly renders the application content using Outlet.
- For protected routes, it wraps the Outlet within SessionAuth, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the content.

## Visit the Authentication Page

Go to the `/auth` page in your browser. If you see a login UI, you have completed this step!

## A Closer Look at `root.tsx` (optional)

Let's take at what is happening in `root.tsx`:

### 1. Initialize SuperTokens on the Frontend

The `typeof window !== "undefined"` check determines whether the code is running in a client-side environment (i.e., in a web browser). If it is, the `SuperTokens.init()` function is called with the configuration provided by the `frontendConfig()` function. This function returns an object containing frontend configuration settings required by SuperTokens.

### 2. Wrap the Application Content with `SuperTokensWrapper`

Inside the `<body>` section, the `<SuperTokensWrapper>` component wraps the application's content, which ensures that SuperTokens is initialized and available for authentication-related operations throughout the application.

### 3. Check for Sessions in Routes

The `useLocation` hook determines if the current path starts with `/auth` (i.e., the unprotected routes). If it does not (`isUnprotectedRoute` becomes set to `false`), then the route is considered protected and requires authentication.

Depending on whether the route is unprotected, either the `<Outlet>` component or the `<SessionAuth>` component is rendered. The `<Outlet>` component renders the content of the current route, while the `<SessionAuth>` component ensures that the content renders only when the user is authenticated. In the latter case, the user will be directed to the requested route after authenticating.

:::info
`SessionAuth` is a component exposed by the SuperTokens React SDK. It checks if a session exists; if it does not, it will redirect the user to the login page.
