# Adding Social Login

## Using Pre-Built UI

### 1) Setup and Initialization

Make sure to finish the steps explained in the initialization guide for the [frontend](../../quick-setup/frontend.mdx) and [backend](../../quick-setup//backend.mdx)

### 2) Navigating to third party login

The SuperTokens SDK provides a pre built form that can be used when signing up and signing in. When the end user clicks on a social provider the SDK navigates to the third party provider's login page

### 3) Handling Third Party Callbacks

The SuperTokens SDK adds a callback route that handles this for you, if succesfull the SDK will navigate to your app.

## Using Custom UI

### 1) Setup and Initialization

Make sure to finish the steps explained in the initialization guide for the [frontend](../../quick-setup/frontend.mdx) and [backend](../../quick-setup//backend.mdx)

### 2) Navigating to third party login

The `getAuthorisationURLWithQueryParamsAndSetState` function returns the full URL that you can use to navigate your users to the third party providers login page

```tsx
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword"

async function onProviderClicked(providerId: string, authorisationURL: string) {
    const thirdPartyAuthURL = await ThirdPartyEmailPassword.getAuthorisationURLWithQueryParamsAndSetState({
        providerId,
        authorisationURL,
    })

    // Navigate to thirdPartyAuthURL
}
```

`providerId` is the identifier for the specific third party provider, it must match the value you set when [configuring third party providers in your backend](../../quick-setup/backend.mdx#3-initialise-social-login-providers).

`authorisationURL` is the URL the user should be redirected to when the third party login is complete.

### 3) Handling Third Party Callbacks

:::important
When using custom UI, you need to set up a route on your frontend app to handle redirection from the third party provider.
:::

When the user is redirected to your frontend application, use the `thirdPartySignInAndUp` to complete the flow:

```tsx
import ThirdPartyEmailPassword from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword"

async function handleThirdPartyCallback() {
    const signInUpResponse = await ThirdPartyEmailPassword.thirdPartySignInAndUp();

    // status is "OK" if the flow was successful
    if (signInUpResponse.status === "OK") {
        // To check if this is a new user
        const didCreateNewUser = signInUpResponse.createdNewUser;
        // Get the user object
        const user = signInUpResponse.user;
    }
}
```
