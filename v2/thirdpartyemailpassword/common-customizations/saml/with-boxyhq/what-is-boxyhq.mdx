# What is BoxyHQ

[BoxyHQ](https://boxyhq.com/) is a commerical open-source company that has a product called [SAML Jackson](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/introduction) which helps integrate SAML providers into your application.

SAML Jackson is a perfect fit with SuperTokens because:
- It's open source
- It has a managed service and a self hosted offering
- It's an OAuth provider and a SAML client. This fits in perfectly with [our architecture](../saml-login).
- For self hosted, it supports PostgreSQL and MySQL amongst [other databases](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/service#database). Self hosted SuperTokens supports PostgreSQL and MySQL as well.

<!-- TODO: add more detail about BoxyHQ? -->

In the next page, we will have a look at the architecture and flow diagram of SuperTokens + SAML Jackson.

:::tip example app
We have an [example app on our GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/jackson-supertokens-express) with SuperTokens + SAML Jackson, for React and NodeJS express apps. This uses [mocksaml.com](https://mocksaml.com/) as a SAML provider
