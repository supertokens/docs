# Delete user

:::important
This is applicable for supertokens core version >= 3.7.

This feature allows you delete a user from the SuperTokens based on their user ID.

```tsx
import {deleteUser} from "supertokens-node";

async function deleteUserForId() {
    let userId = "..." // get the user ID
    await deleteUser(userId); // this will succeed even if the userId didn't exist.
}
```

<TabItem value="go">

```go
import "github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/supertokens"

func main() {
	userId := "..." // get the user ID somehow...
	supertokens.DeleteUser(userId) // this will succeed even if the userId didn't exist.
}
```

<TabItem value="asyncio">

```python
from supertokens_python.asyncio import delete_user

user_id = "..." # get the user ID somehow...
await delete_user(user_id) # this will succeed even if the userId didn't exist.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="syncio">

```python
from supertokens_python.syncio import delete_user

user_id = "..." # get the user ID somehow...
delete_user(user_id) # this will succeed even if the userId didn't exist.
```

:::caution
- Calling this function will permanently remove all information associated with this user, including their sessions.
- If this user has an active access token, and you have not enabled access token blacklisting, session verificaiton will still succeed until their access token expires. After that, they will be logged out since session refresh will fail.
