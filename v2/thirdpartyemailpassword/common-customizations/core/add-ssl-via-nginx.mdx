# Adding SSL via NGINX

This section will guide you through setting up SSL via NGINX so you can query the SuperTokens Core with a secure connection.

:::important
- This guide assumes you have already installed NGINX on your server.
- For the example given below we will be running the SuperToknes core on domain `localhost` and port `3567`
:::

## 1. Reverse Proxy the SuperTokens Core with NGINX

The SuperTokens core does not support SSL so we need to use NGINX as a reverse proxy to setup a secure connection.

We can start by editing the default NGINX site config file found at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`
 
- In the config you want to scroll down to the `server` directive.

- By default it should look like this:

  ```text title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  localhost;
  ...
}
  ```

We can now configure the `server` directive by adding the `location` directive with the following values:

  ```text title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;
    // highlight-start
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3567;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
  // highlight-end
}
  ```

The `location` directive tells NGINX what to do with the incoming request, `proxy_pass` will point the redirect to `localhost:3567`

You can now test and apply the changes to the NGINX by running the following command:

  ```bash
nginx -t && service nginx restart
  ```

We can use the `/hello` api of the SuperTokens core to test the connection.

Navigate to `http://localhost/hello` and check if it gives a valid response from the core.

## 2. Setting up SSL

We now need to obtain a digital certificate to enable a secure connection with a users browser.

We are going to be using a self signed certificates since we are developing locally, but, you can also use a certificate autorities like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate valid certificates.

- Run the following command to generate a self signed certificate using OpenSSL:

   ```bash
 openssl req -x509 -nodes newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt
   ```

- You can set the values `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` in the NGINX config to specify the locations of the newly generated certificates.

  ```text title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
server {
    listen       80;
    listen       443 ssl;
    server_name  localhost;
    // highlight-start
    ssl_certificate  /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;
    // highlight-end
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
  ```
:::important
If you decide to use self signed certificates, browsers will show a warning that the “Certificate is not Trusted”. Make sure to use a valid certificate in production.
:::

Run the test and resetart commands to test and apply your changes:

  ```bash
nginx -t && service nginx restart
  ```
