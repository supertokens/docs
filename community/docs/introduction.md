# Supported tech stacks ðŸ™Œ
### On the backend:
- **NodeJS**: We support all current functionality (signup, manage auth tokens, social login etc).
- **GoLang** and **Python** based frameworks (Flask, FastAPI and Django) are currently in development and will be launched early August, 2021.
- **PHP** and **Java** based frameworks (Laravel, Spring Boot) are currently not supported. 

For unsupported frameworks (such as Laravel and Spring), please submit your request on the [product roadmap page](/product-roadmap). Alternatively, you can build and contribute these SDKs with our help. Reach out to us on [Discord](/discord).

### On the frontend:
- **ReactJS**: We support all current functionality (signup, manage auth tokens, social login etc).
- **Vanilla JS**, **Angular**, **Vue** and others: We provide session management only and you would have to build the frontend UI for login.
- **Mobile app**: We currently do not support any mobile app framework.
