# Migrating to SuperTokens Pro

## Free trial
Once you move to the Pro version, you will get 30 days of free trial:
- If you choose to continue using the Pro version after, you will need to setup a subscription with us. 
- In case you do not want to do that, the core will automatically migrate to the community version. No action will be required from your part. This will happen with 0 downtime.

## Steps to migration

#### 1) Upgrade your app via the dashboard
- Click on the "Upgrade to pro" button for your app on the dashboard. This will move your app to the pro version.
- The version of SuperTokens pro that is compatible with your community version will be displayed on the dashboard.

#### 2) Update SuperTokens core
- If you are running SuperTokens community version, please run ```supertokens update``` to move it to the pro version. Any running process will be restarted with minimum downtime (at most 2-3 seconds).
- If you are not running / using the community version, then please see this [installation guide](/docs/pro/getting-started/installation). Please be sure to see the correct version of the docs.
