# License Keys

A license key is needed for the SuperTokens core to run:
- This key is provided to you in the zip file you install via the dashboard.
- This key can be downloaded separately from the dashboard and can be loaded into the core via the ```supertokens load-license``` [command](./cli/load-license)

For the community version, the provided key never expires.

<div class="specialNote">
Please make sure that your license key is not leaked. In the event that you think it has been leaked, please <a href="mailto:team@supertokens.io">contact us</a> to get a new one.
