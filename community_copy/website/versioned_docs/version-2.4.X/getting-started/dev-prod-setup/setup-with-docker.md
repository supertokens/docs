# Setup on premises with Docker

### 1) See Docker README.md and start the Docker container
Visit the [Docker](../../docker) section to find the `docker pull` command and its `README`. SuperTokens will use an in-memory database if you do not provide the relevant database config values to it.

### 2) Integrate into your app
- Go to the [Backend SDK Integration](../../backend-integration) section to see documentation for integrating SuperTokens with your backend APIs
- Go to the [Frontend SDK Integration](../../frontend-integration) section to see documentation for integrating SuperTokens with your frontend clients.

-----------

## Connecting to your database
Please visit the relevant database page under the [Database Setup section](../database-setup/mysql)
