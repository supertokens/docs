# Core overview ðŸš€

The following are the options for running the Core:
- Self-hosted: You can run the Core yourself on your servers, talking to your database.
   - [With Docker](./self-hosted/with-docker): This is the recommended way since it's easy to install and manage.
   - [Without Docker](./self-hosted/without-docker): Use this method if you are not using Docker. We support Linux, Mac and Windows.
- [Managed service](./saas-setup): We run the SuperTokens Core for you on an AWS region of your choice. The database will be managed by us too.
