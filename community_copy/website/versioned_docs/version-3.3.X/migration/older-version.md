# Migrating from an older version of SuperTokens

> The applies to users who are using SuperTokens version that is <= 2.5 and want to move to a version that is >= 3.0

On a higher level, you need to:
- Update the frontend and backend SDKs being used
- Update the SuperTokens core version being used
- Create a refresh API to refresh existing sessions
- Change your existing SuperTokens code to use the new import statements
- Change a few function calls to their new names (if you are using them)

The above being said, the steps may differ depending on your current setup and we thought it would be best if we guide you through it on a one-to-one basis (for free!).
