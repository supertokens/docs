- The sign up form asks you to choose a database - this is where your app's session data will be stored.

### 2) Go to your [dashboard](/dashboard) to download SuperTokens core
- For the listed app, select for which platform / OS and which version of SuperTokens you would like to download.
- You can also change the default app name.
- Click on the download button. This will start a zip download

### 3) Install SuperTokens
