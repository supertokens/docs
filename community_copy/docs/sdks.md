# NodeJS (login + sessions) (Backend)

SuperTokens currently supports authentication and session management for NodeJS.
See the [supertokens-node](/docs/nodejs/installation) reference API documentation for more information.

# ReactJS (login + sessions) (Frontend)

SuperTokens currently supports authentication and session management with ReactJS.
See the [supertokens-auth-react](/docs/auth-react/installation) reference API documentation for more information.

# Sessions only (Frontend)

If you want to only implement session management with SuperTokens, then you can use any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular etc..) along with our [supertokens-website](/docs/website/installation) SDK.

# Other SDKs
We also support many other SDKs for session management only. We are working on updating them to support the newer login features. You can view their guide [via our older docs](/docs/community/2.5.X/backend-integration).
