# Self-Hosting SuperTokens

## Overview 

One of the main features of **SuperTokens** is that you can run it using your own resources.
This way you have full control over the authentication data and you can scale based on your needs.

## Requirements

In order to deploy the Core Service you will have to configure two things: the actual API and the database.

### Database

We support both **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** as a data source for our core service.
Check out the guides for information on how to initialize the database: [**MySQL**](/docs/deployment/self-hosting/database-setup/mysql), [**PostgreSQL**](/docs/deployment/self-hosting/database-setup/postgresql).

### SuperTokens Core

Our core service can be deployed as a standalone server in your compute infrastructure.
If you are using Docker check our [specific guide](/docs/deployment/self-hosting/with-docker) that shows you how to run the application. 
Otherwise, we provide [additional instructions](/docs/deployment/self-hosting/without-docker) on how to install the core service inside a VM. 


## License Keys


In order to access some of the features in your self-hosted service you will have to make use of **license keys**.
You can sign up on [**SuperTokens**](https://supertokens.com/auth) to receive one. 

Once you have the license key you need to manually add it to your **SuperTokens Core Instance**.
To do this you will have to call the Core API with the following request:

```bash title="Add License Key" showAppTypeSelect
curl --location --request PUT ^{coreInfo.uri}/ee/license \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'api-key: ^{coreInfo.key}' \
     --data-raw '{ "licenseKey": "<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>" }'

```
