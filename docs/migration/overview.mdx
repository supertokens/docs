# Overview

<DescriptionText>
  The **Migration** section covers instructions on how you can move your authentication data from your current authentication solution to **SuperTokens** 
</DescriptionText>

<Separator />

## Before You Start

The migration steps are intended to be executed after you have configured your [initial **SuperTokens** integration](/docs/quickstart/introduction).
Hence, to complete any of the next instructions you will need the following:
- An existing application that has a working **SuperTokens** integration. You can follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/introduction) for instructions on how to achieve this.
- A **SuperTokens** managed service account or a self-hosted **SuperTokens Core** instance.
More specifically, you will have to make HTTP requests to your `CORE_API_ENDPOINT` using an `API_KEY`. 


## Migration Steps

The entire migration process can be broken down into two steps.
Both are required to achieve a seamless transition. 

1. [**Account Migration**](/docs/migration/account-migration/)

This is the main part of the migration flow.
You will be importing your users, together with their account credentials, from the legacy authentication provider into **SuperTokens**.

2. [**Session Migration**](/docs/migration/session-migration)

This step prevents any users with active sessions from experiencing authentication issues.
You will extend the **SuperTokens** functionality to create new sessions for users that have authenticated using your legacy provider.


:::info

You need to keep using your legacy authentication provider until you have implemented all the migration steps.
After that, you can go ahead and switch to **SuperTokens** in your production application.

With that in mind, you can now move to the first step, the [**Account Migration**](/docs/migration/account-migration/) process.
