# Add SSL via nginx

## Overview

This section guides you through setting up SSL via Nginx to query the SuperTokens Core with a secure connection.

## Before you start

:::caution no-title
This page is only relevant if you are self hosting SuperTokens. 
:::

This guide assumes you have already installed Nginx on your server.

## Steps

The following example guide runs SuperTokens `localhost:3567`

### 1. Reverse proxy the SuperTokens core with nginx

The SuperTokens core does not support SSL, and Nginx is needed as a reverse proxy to set up a secure connection.

Start by opening the default Nginx site configuration file in a code editor. This file resides at:
  - Linux: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.
  - Mac: `/usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.
  - Windows: `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf`. 

In the configuration, scroll down to the `server` directive.

- By default it should look like this:

  ```text title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
  server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;
    ...
  }
  ```

- Configure the `server` directive by adding the `location` directive with the following values:

  ```text title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
  server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;
    // highlight-start
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3567;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
  ```

The `location` directive tells Nginx what to do with the incoming request, `proxy_pass` points the redirect to `localhost:3567`.

- Test and apply the changes to Nginx by running the following command:

  ```bash
  nginx -t && service nginx restart
  ```

We can use the `/hello` API of the SuperTokens core to test the connection.

Navigate to `http://localhost/hello` and check if it gives a valid response from the core.

### 2. Set up SSL

Obtain a digital certificate to enable a secure connection with a user's browser.

Self-signed certificates will be used since development is local. However, certificate authorities like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) can also generate valid certificates.

- Run the following command to generate a self signed certificate using OpenSSL:

  ```bash
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt
  ```

- Set the values `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` in the Nginx configuration to specify the locations of the newly generated certificates.

  ```text title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
  server {
    listen       80;
    listen       443 ssl;
    server_name  localhost;
    // highlight-start
    ssl_certificate  /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;
    // highlight-end
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
  }
  ```

- Run the test and restart commands to test and apply your changes:

```bash
nginx -t && service nginx restart
```
