# Filter requests based on IP address

## Overview

You can set the SuperTokens core's configuration such that it accepts / denies requests that originate from certain IPs.
This ensures that only your backend can query the SuperTokens core - increasing the security.

## Before you start

:::caution no-title
This page is only relevant if you are self hosting SuperTokens. 

For managed service, please navigate to [your dashboard](https://supertokens.com/dashboard) and go to the edit configuration section to set this value.

## Allow requests 

<SelfHostingTabs>
<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
 docker run \
    -p 3567:3567 \
    -e IP_ALLOW_REGEX="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" \ 
    -d registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name>
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>

<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="without-docker">

```yaml
# You need to add the following to the config.yaml file.
# The file path can be found by running the "supertokens --help" command

ip_allow_regex: 127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above only allows requests that originate from an IP that matches `127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1` regular expression. A breakdown of this regex is:
- `127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+`: IPs that start with `127.`; OR
- `::1`: IPv6 from localhost; OR
- `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`: IPv6 from localhost

In this way, only requests from localhost are allowed, and for other requests, the core returns a `403` status code. If instead you want to allow a list of IP addresses that correspond to your backend server's IP address, you can set this value to `IP1|IP2|IP3...` - for example: `100.12.12.3|192.167.4.3|50.32.5.1`.

If this value is not set, then the core allows requests from any IP address.

---

## Deny requests 

This is the opposite of the above configuration. If you only set this, the core allows requests from any IP other than the one that matches the regular expression corresponding to this setting.

<SelfHostingTabs>
<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="with-docker">

```bash
 docker run \
    -p 3567:3567 \
    // highlight-next-line
    -e IP_DENY_REGEX="100.1.1.3" \ 
    -d registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name>
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>

<SelfHostingTabs.TabItem value="without-docker">

```yaml
# You need to add the following to the config.yaml file.
# The file path can be found by running the "supertokens --help" command

ip_deny_regex: 100.1.1.3
```
</SelfHostingTabs.TabItem>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above setting makes the core accept requests from any IP other than `100.1.1.3`. For `100.1.1.3`, it returns a `403`.

:::info What if you set both the configurations?

In this case, the core allows requests only based on the value of `ip_allow_regex`, as long that request's IP doesn't match the regex of `ip_deny_regex`. For example, if you set `ip_allow_regex: IP1|IP2` and `ip_deny_regex: IP1`, then the core accepts requests only from `IP2`.
