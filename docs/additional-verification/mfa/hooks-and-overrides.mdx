# Hooks and overrides

**SuperTokens** exposes a set of constructs that allow you to trigger different actions during the authentication lifecycle or to even fully customize the logic based on your use case. 
The following sections describe how you can modify adjust the `mfa` recipe to your needs.

Explore the [references pages](/docs/references) for a more in depth guide on hooks and overrides.

## Frontend event hooks

The pre-built UI emits a few events that you can listen to on the frontend. As an example, you can use these for analytics:

## Backend overrides

It's a common use case to want to override the default behavior of SuperTokens after a user signs up or signs in.
For example, you may want to change your database state whenever someone signs up.
You can do this by overriding the sign up / sign in recipe functions in the backend SDK:
- [Passwordless recipe](/docs/authentication/passwordless/hooks-and-overrides)
- [EmailPassword recipe](/docs/authentication/email-password/hooks-and-overrides)
- [ThirdParty recipe](/docs/authentication/social/hooks-and-overrides)

Since the sign up / sign in APIs share functionality for first factor and second factor login, your override applies to both first and second factor login. If you want to have different behavior for first and second factor login, you can use the `input` argument to the function to determine if the user is doing first or second factor login.

The `input` argument contains the `session` object using which you can determine if the user is doing first or second factor login. If the `session` property is `undefined`, it means it's a first factor login, else it's a second factor login. In the links above, the code snippets check for `input.session === undefined` to determine if it's a first factor login.
