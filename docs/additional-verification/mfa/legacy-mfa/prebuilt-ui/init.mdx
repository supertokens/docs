:::info Caution
This is the legacy method of implementing MFA. It has several [disadvantages](../legacy-vs-new) compared to using our MFA recipe.

# 1. Recipe init

To start, we want to initialise the [ThirdParty + EmailPassword](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/quick-setup/frontend), the [Passwordless](https://supertokens.com/docs/passwordless/quick-setup/frontend) and the MFA recipes:

<AppInfoForm />

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import EmailPassword from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword';
import ThirdParty from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdparty';
import Passwordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/passwordless";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import MultiFactorAuth from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/multifactorauth";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        appName: "^{appInfo.appName}",
        apiDomain: "^{appInfo.apiDomain}",
        websiteDomain: "^{appInfo.websiteDomain}",
        apiBasePath: "^{appInfo.apiBasePath}",
        websiteBasePath: "^{appInfo.websiteBasePath}"
    },
    recipeList: [
        // first factor method
        EmailPassword.init(),
        ThirdParty.init({
            // ...
        }),
        // second factor method
        Passwordless.init({
            contactMethod: "PHONE"
        }),
        Session.init(),
        MultiFactorAuth.init({
            firstFactors: ["emailpassword", "thirdparty"],
        }),
    ]
});
```

Notice that in the `MultiFactorAuth` init, we pass in the list of `firstFactors`. This will tell SuperTokens to only show email password + third party login in the pre-built UI for the first factor, even though we have also added `Passwordless.init` in the recipe list.

In the subsequent sections, we will be seeing how to modify theses `init` calls so that we can achieve the flow we want. On a high level, we will be:
- Rendering the Passwordless login UI on a custom path.
- Auto skipping the screen which asks the user to input their phone number if we already have it - post sign in.
- Implementing a logout button on the second factor pre-built UI screen.

:::info Important
In the guide, we will assume that the first factor path is `/auth`, and the second factor path is `/second-factor`.
