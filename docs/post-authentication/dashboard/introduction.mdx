# Dashboard

## Overview

With the user management dashboard, you can perform actions through a user interface.
This allows you to view and modify tenants and users through different web actions.

## Getting started

To get a quick understanding of how the dashboard looks and what it can do you can visit the [live demo](https://dashboard.demo.supertokens.io/api/auth/dashboard).
The credentials for logging in are: `email: demo@supertokens.com` and `password: abcd1234`.

Alternatively, you can follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/post-authentication/dashboard/initial-setup) to configure the dashboard in your **SuperTokens** integration.
