# User management

## Overview

With the user management dashboard you can view the list of users and their details.
You can also perform different operations on these users as mentioned below.

--- 

## Create users

If you have created your app, you may not have any users to show on the dashboard.

## List users

Navigate to your frontend app and create a user (via the sign-up flow). On creation, if you head back to the dashboard and refresh the page, you see that user:

## View user details

When you select a user you can view detailed information about the user such as email, phone number, user metadata, etc.

## Create user roles and permissions

:::caution no-title
This feature is only available through the Node.js SDK.

When you first use the `UserRoles` recipe, the list of roles is empty. To create roles, click on the "Add Role" button.

This action opens a modal, enabling you to create a role along with its associated permissions. Permissions are essentially a list of strings assigned to a specific role.

You can preview the role you created by clicking on the role row. The modal provides options to edit or delete the role.

## Assign user roles

:::caution no-title

To assign a specific role to a user, start by finding the user in the dashboard. Upon clicking the user, navigate to the user details page where you find a section for user roles.

If the selected user has associations with multiple tenants, you can choose a `tenantId` from the dropdown menu to specify the tenant for which you'd like to assign roles.

Click the edit button to start assigning roles. Then, select the "Assign Role" button, and a modal appears with a list of available roles for assignment to this user.
