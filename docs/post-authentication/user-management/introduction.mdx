# User management

## Overview

Users are at the core of every authentication flow.
Each **SuperTokens** recipe interacts with users in a way or another.
They get created either from the recipe sign up flow, through the migration API or because of direct SDK calls.

## Prerequisites

This section assumes that you are familiar with basic **SuperTokens** concepts like **recipes**, **sessions** and authentication methods.
If not, please refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/introduction) first.


## Customization 

Besides the common actions which you can use to manage users, you can also integrate different features which allow you extend the user functionality.
