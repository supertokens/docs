# Automatic account linking

## Overview

Automatic account linking is a feature that allows users to automatically sign in to their existing account using more than one login method. On a high level, SuperTokens automatically links the accounts for the different login methods provided that:
- Their emails or phone numbers are the same.
- They have verified their emails or phone numbers.

SuperTokens ensures that accounts are automatically linked only if there is no risk of account takeover.

## Steps

### 1. Enable the recipe

You can enable this feature by providing the following callback implementation on the backend SDK:

import { SessionContainerInterface } from "supertokens-node/recipe/session/types";

// Prevent account linking if the user already exists in your database
function checkIfUserHasAssociatedInformation(accountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId & { recipeUserId?: RecipeUserId }, user: User | undefined): boolean {
  if(!accountInfo.recipeUserId || !user) return false;

  const userId = accountInfo.recipeUserId.getAsString();
  const hasAssociatedInformation = false

## Input 

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `newAccountInfo` | `AccountInfoWithRecipeId & { recipeUserId?: RecipeUserId }` | Contains information about the user whose account is going to link or become a primary user. Includes email, social login info, phone number, and login method (`emailpassword`, `thirdparty`, or `passwordless`). May contain `recipeUserId` during account linking. Note: When `newAccountInfo.recipeUserId !== undefined && user !== undefined`, extra logic checks if the user ID has associated data in your application db to prevent data loss. |
| `user` | `User \| undefined` | If not `undefined`, indicates `newAccountInfo` user links to this user. If `undefined`, `newAccountInfo` user becomes a primary user. |
| `session` | `SessionContainerInterface \| undefined` | Session object of the user who is linking. `undefined` for first factor login. Defined if user completed first factor and calls sign up/in API again (MFA or social login linking). |
| `tenant` | `string` | ID of the tenant the user is signing in/up to. |
| `userContext` | `any` | User defined context object. |

## Output

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `shouldAutomaticallyLink` | `boolean` | If `true`, `newAccountInfo` links or becomes primary user during API call (subject to security checks). If `false`, no account linking operation occurs. |
| `shouldRequireVerification` | `boolean` | If `true`, account linking only happens if `newAccountInfo` verifies. **Strongly recommended to keep as `true` for security.** |

</Accordion>

:::important
If you are returning `shouldRequireVerification` as `true`, then you need to also [enable the email verification recipe](/docs/additional-verification/email-verification/initial-setup) in `REQUIRED` mode. This means that if the login method does not inherently verify the email (like for email password login), SuperTokens requires the user to go through the email verification flow first. Then, it attempts auto linking of the account. For other login methods like sign in with Google, the email is already verified during login. The user does not need to verify the email again, and account linking occurs immediately.

If you enable email verification in `OPTIONAL` mode, the user can access the account after email password login. However, account linking only occurs after they verify their email later on. This is risky because while the user had access to their email password account after sign up, they could lose access after verification and account linking completes due to the change in the primary user ID. A callback is available to help migrate data from one user ID to another.
:::

You can use the input of the function to dynamically decide if you want to do account linking for a particular user and / or login method or not.


## References

### Automatic account linking scenarios

#### During sign up

If there exists another account with the same email or phone number within the current tenant, the new account links to the existing account if:
    - The existing account is a primary user
    - If `shouldRequireVerification` is `true`, the new account needs creation via a method that has the email as verified (for example via passwordless or google login). If the new method doesn't inherently verify the email (like in email password login), the accounts link post email verification.
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

#### During sign in

If the current user is not already linked and if there exists another user with the same email or phone number within the current tenant, the accounts link if:
    - The user signing into is not a primary user, and the other user with the same email / phone number is a primary user
    - If `shouldRequireVerification` is `true`, the current account (that's signing into) has its email as verified.
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

#### After email verification

If the current user whose email got verified is not a primary user, and there exists another primary user in the same tenant with the same email, then the two accounts link if:
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.

:::info no-title
For a primary user, if two login methods (L1 & L2) share the same email, but L1's email verifies and L2's does not, SuperTokens automatically verifies L2's email under these conditions:
-   The user logs in with L2.
-   The `updateEmailOrPassword` (email password recipe) or `updateUser` (passwordless recipe) function calls to update L2's email to match L1's.
:::

#### During the password reset flow

If there already exists a user with the same email in a non email password recipe (social login for example), and the user is doing a password reset flow, a new email password user creates and links to the existing account if:
    - The non email password user is a primary user.
    - Your implementation for `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` returns `true` for the `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean.


:::info Email update implications
When updating a user's login email, SuperTokens ensures account linking conditions remain valid.
A primary user's email cannot update to match another primary user's email.

User A has login methods `AL1` (email `e1`) and `AL2` (email `e1`). User B has login methods `BL1` (email `e2`) and `BL2` (email `e3`). Updating `AL1`'s email to `e2` or `e3` is not allowed, as it would create two primary users with the same email.

**Email updates occur in these scenarios:**

*   `updateEmailOrPassword` function (email password recipe)
*   `updateUser` function (passwordless recipe)
*   Social login (if email from provider has changed)

If the update violates account linking rules, the operation fails:

*   Function calls return a status indicating the update was impossible.
*   Social login API calls return a status prompting the user to contact support.
:::

### User data changes during account linking

When two accounts link, the primary user ID of the non primary user changes.
For example, if User A has a primary user ID `p1` and user B, which is a non primary user, has a user ID of `p2`, and they link, then the primary user ID of User B changes to `p1`.

This has an effect that if the user logs in with login method from User B, the `session.getUserId()` returns `p1`.
If there was any older data associated with User B (against user ID `p2`), in your database, that data essentially becomes "lost".

To prevent this scenario, you should:
- Make sure that you return `false` for `shouldAutomaticallyLink` boolean in the `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` function implementation if there exists a `recipeUserId` in the `newAccountInfo` object, and if you have some information related to that user ID in your own database.
This appears in the [code snippet above](#enabling-automatic-account-linking).
- If you do not want to return `false` in this case, and want the accounts to link, then make sure to implement the `onAccountLinked` callback:
<br />
    ```tsx
    import supertokens, { User, RecipeUserId } from "supertokens-node"
    import AccountLinking from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking";
    import { AccountInfoWithRecipeId, RecipeLevelUser } from "supertokens-node/recipe/accountlinking/types";
    import { SessionContainerInterface } from "supertokens-node/recipe/session/types";

    supertokens.init({
        supertokens: {
            connectionURI: "...",
            apiKey: "..."
        },
        appInfo: {
            apiDomain: "...",
            appName: "...",
            websiteDomain: "..."
        },
        recipeList: [
            AccountLinking.init({
                shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking: async (newAccountInfo: AccountInfoWithRecipeId & { recipeUserId?: RecipeUserId }, user: User | undefined, session: SessionContainerInterface | undefined, tenantId: string, userContext: any) => {
                    return {
                        shouldAutomaticallyLink: true,
                        shouldRequireVerification: true
                    }
                },
                // highlight-start
                onAccountLinked: async (user: User, newAccountInfo: RecipeLevelUser, userContext: any) => {
                    let olderUserId = newAccountInfo.recipeUserId.getAsString()
                    let newUserId = user.id;

                    // TODO: migrate data from olderUserId to newUserId in your database... 
                }
                // highlight-end
            })
        ]
    });
    ```

:::caution
If your logic in `onAccountLinked` throws an error, then it is not called again, and still results in linking the accounts. However, the end user would see an error on the UI as the API returns a `500` status code. They can retry the login action and log into the primary user's account as expected. 
:::

### Error status codes

The following is a list of error status codes that the end user might see during their interaction with the login UI (as a general error message in the pre-built UI).

<Accordion px="4">

## `ERR_CODE_001` 

- This can happen during creating a password reset code in the email password flow:
    - API path and method: `/user/password/reset/token POST` 
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "PASSWORD_RESET_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason":
            "Reset password link was not created because of account take over risk. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_001)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:

    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_001.png" alt="pre-built UI screenshot showing error message for ERR_CODE_001." style={{ height: "400px" }}/>

- Below is the scenario for when this status returns:
    
A malicious user, User A, which is a primary user, has login methods with email `e1` (social login) and email `e1` (`emailpassword` login). If user A changes their `emailpassword` email to `e2` (which is in unverified state), and the real user of `e2` (the victim) tries to sign up via email password, they see a message saying that the email already exists. The victim may then try to do a password reset (thinking they had previously signed up). If this happens, and the victim resets the password (since they are the real owner of the email), then they can login to the account, and the attacker can spy on what the user is doing via their third party login method.

To prevent this scenario, enforcement ensures that the password link is only generated if the primary user has at least one login method that has the input email ID and verifies it, or if not, checks that the primary user has no other login method with a different email, or phone number. If these cases are not satisfied, then the system returns the error code `ERR_CODE_001`.

- To resolve this, you would have to manually verify the user's identity and check that they own each of the emails / phone numbers associated with the primary user. Once verified, you can manually mark the email from the email password account as verified, and then ask them to go through the password reset flow once again. If they do not own each of the emails / phone numbers associated with the account, you can manually unlink the login methods which they do not own, and then ask them to go through the password reset flow once again. **You can do these actions using the user management dashboard.**

## `ERR_CODE_002`

- This can happen during the passwordless recipe's create or consume code API (during sign up):
    - API path and method: `/signinup/code POST` or `/signinup/code/consume POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please try a different login method or contact support. (ERR_CODE_002)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:

    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_002.png" alt="pre-built UI screenshot showing error message for ERR_CODE_002." style={{ height: "400px" }} />

- Below is an example scenario for when this status returns (one amongst many):
A user is trying to sign up using passwordless login method with email `e1`. There exists an email password login method with `e1`, which remains unverified (owned by an attacker). If this scenario occurs, and then the attacker initiates the email verification flow for the email password method, the real user might click on the verification email (since they signed up, they do not get suspicious), and then the attacker's login method links to the passwordless login method. This way, the attacker gains access to the user's account.

    To prevent this, sign up with passwordless login is not allowed in case there exists another account with the same email and remains unverified.

- To resolve this issue, you should ask the user to try another login method (which already has their email), or then mark their email as verified in the other account that has the same email, before asking them to retry passwordless login. **You can do these actions using the user management dashboard.**


## `ERR_CODE_003`

This used to be an error code which is no longer valid and you can ignore it.

## `ERR_CODE_004`
  
- This can happen during the third party recipe's `/signinup` API (during sign in):
    - API path and method: `/signinup POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please try a different login method or contact support. (ERR_CODE_004)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_004.png" alt="Pre-built UI screenshot showing error for message ERR_CODE_004." style={{ height: "400px" }}/>

- Below is an example scenario for when this status returns (one amongst many):
There exists a `thirdparty` user with email `e1`, sign in with Google (owned by the victim, and the email is verified). There exists another `thirdparty` login method with email, `e2` (owned by an attacker), such as login with GitHub. The attacker then goes to their GitHub and changes their email to `e1` (which is in unverified state). The next time the attacker tries to login, via GitHub, they see this error code. Login is prevented, because if it wasn't, then the attacker might send an email verification link to `e1`, and if the victim clicks on it, then the attacker's account will link to the victim's account.

- To resolve this issue, you can delete the login method that has the unverified email, or if manually mark the unverified account as verified (if you confirm the identity of its owner). **You can do these actions using the user management dashboard.**

## `ERR_CODE_005`

- This can happen during the third party recipe's `signinup` API (during sign in):
    - API path and method: `/signinup POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason": "Cannot sign in / up because new email cannot be applied to existing account. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_005)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_005.png" alt="Pre-built UI screenshot showing error message for ERR_CODE_005." style={{ height: "400px" }}/>

- Below is as example scenario for when this status returns (one amongst many):
There exists a primary, third party user with email `e1`, sign in with Google. There exists another email password user with email `e2`, which is a primary user. If the user changes their email on Google to `e2`, and then try logging in via Google, they see this error code. This occurs because if it wasn't, then it would result in two primary users having the same email, which violates one of the account linking rules.

- To resolve this issue, you can make one of the primary users as non primary (use the unlink button against the login method on the user management dashboard). Once the user is not a primary user, you can ask the user to re-login with that method, and it should auto link that account with the existing primary user.

## `ERR_CODE_006`

- This can happen during the third party recipe's `signinup` API (during sign up):
    - API path and method: `/signinup POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason": "Cannot sign in / up because new email cannot be applied to existing account. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_006)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_006.png" alt="Pre-built UI screenshot showing error message for ERR_CODE_006." style={{ height: "400px" }}/>

- Below is as example scenario for when this status returns (one amongst many):
A user is trying to sign up using third party login method with email `e1`. There exists an email password login method with `e1`, which remains unverified (owned by an attacker). If the third party sign up is allowed, and then the attacker initiates the email verification flow for the email password method, the real user might click on the verification email (since they signed up, they do not get suspicious), and then the attacker's login method links to the third party login method. This way, the attacker has access to the user's account.

    To prevent this, sign up with third party login is not allowed in case there exists another account with the same email and remains unverified.

- To resolve this issue, you should ask the user to try another login method (which already has their email), or then manually mark their email as verified in the other account that has the same email, before asking them to retry third party login. **You can do these actions using the user management dashboard.**

## `ERR_CODE_007`

- This can happen during the email password sign up API:
    - API path and method: `/signup POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason": "Cannot sign up due to security reasons. Please try logging in, use a different login method or contact support. (ERR_CODE_007)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_007.png" alt="Pre-built UI screenshot showing error message for ERR_CODE_007." style={{ height: "400px" }}/>

- Below is as example scenario for when this status returns (one amongst many):
There exists a primary, social login account with email `e1`, sign in with Google. If an attacker tries to sign up with email password with email `e1`, the system sends an email verification email to the victim, and they may click it since they had previously signed up with Google. This links the attacker's account to the victim's account.

- To resolve this issue, you can ask the user to try and login, or go through the reset password flow.

## `ERR_CODE_008`

- This can happen during the email password sign in API:
    - API path and method: `/signin POST`
    - Output JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "SIGN_IN_NOT_ALLOWED",
        "reason": "Cannot sign in due to security reasons. Please try resetting your password, use a different login method or contact support. (ERR_CODE_008)"
    }
    ```
    - The pre-built UI on the frontend displays this error in the following way:
    <img src="/img/account-linking/err_008.png" alt="Pre-built UI screenshot showing error message for ERR_CODE_008." style={{ height: "400px" }}/>

- Below is as example scenario for when this status returns (one amongst many):
There exists a primary, social login account with email `e1`, sign in with Google. There also exists an email password account (owned by the attacker) that remains unverified with the same email `e1` (this is not a primary user). If the attacker tries to sign in with email password, they see this error. This occurs because if it wasn't, then the attacker might send an email verification email on sign in, and the actual user may click on it (since they had previously signed up). Upon verifying that account, the system links the attacker's account to the victim's account.

- To resolve this issue, you can ask the user to try the reset password flow.

## `ERR_CODE_014`

- This can happen when adding a password to an existing session user:
    - API Path is `/signup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_014)"
        }
        ```
- An example scenario of when in the following scenario:
- Let's say that the app configures to not have automatic account linking during the first factor.
    - A user creates an email password account with email `e1`, verifies it, and links social login account to it with email `e2`.
- The user logs out, and then creates a social login account with email `e1`. Then, they receive a request to add a password to this account. Since an email password account with `e1` already exists, SuperTokens tries and links that to this new account, but fails, since the email password account with `e1` is already a primary user.

- To resolve this, it is recommended to manually link the `e1` social login account with the `e1` email password account. Alternatively, enable automatic account linking for first factor to prevent the above scenario.

## `ERR_CODE_015`

- This can happen when adding a password to an existing session user:
    - API Path is `/signup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_015)"
        }
        ```
- An example scenario of when in the following scenario:
    - A user creates a social login account with email `e1` which becomes a primary user.
    - The user logs out, and creates another social login account with email `e2`, which also becomes a primary user.
- The user receives a request to add a password for the new account with an option to also specify an email with it (this is strange, but theoretically possible). They enter the email `e1` for the email password account.
- This causes this type of error since the linking of the new social login and email account fails since there already exists another primary user with the same (`e1`) email.

- To resolve this, it is recommended not allowing users to specify an email when asking them to add a password for their account.

## `ERR_CODE_016`

- This can happen when adding a password to an existing session user:
    - API Path is `/signup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_016)"
        }
        ```
- An example scenario of when in the following scenario:
    - Let's say that the app is configured to not have automatic account linking during the first factor.
    - A user signs up with a social login account using Google with email `e1`, and they add another social account, with Facebook, with the same email.
    - The user logs out and creates another social login account with email `e1` (say GitHub), and then tries and adds a password to this account with email `e1`. Here, SuperTokens tries and makes the GitHub login a primary user, but fails, since the email `e1` is already a primary user (with Google login). 

- To resolve this, it is recommended that you manually link the `e1` GitHub social login account with the `e1` Google social login account. Or you can enable automatic account linking for first factor and this way, the above scenario will not happen.

## `ERR_CODE_020`

- This can happen during association of a third party login to an existing session's account.
    - API Path is `/signinup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_020)"
        }
        ```
- This can happen when the third party account that is trying to link to the session's account is not verified. It could happen when you are trying to associate a social login account to a user, but that social account's email is not verified (and if the email of that account is not the same as the current session's account's email). 
- To resolve this, you can return `shouldRequireVerification` as `false` in the `shouldDoAutomaticAccountLinking` function implementation, or you can only allow users to link social login accounts that give verified accounts.

## `ERR_CODE_021`

- This can happen during association of a third party login to an existing session's account.
    - API Path is `/signinup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_021)"
        }
        ```
- This can happen when the third party account that is trying to link to the session's account is already linked with another primary user.

## `ERR_CODE_022`

- This can happen during association of a third party login to an existing session's account.
    - API Path is `/signinup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_022)"
        }
        ```
- This can happen when the third party account that is trying to link to the session's account has the same email as another primary user. 

## `ERR_CODE_023`

- This can happen during association of a third party login to an existing session's account.
    - API Path is `/signinup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_023)"
        }
        ```
- To link the third party user with the session user, we need to make sure that the session user is a primary user. However, that can fail if there exists another primary user with the same email as the session user, and in this case, this error returns to the frontend.

## `ERR_CODE_024`

- This happens during third party sign in, when the user is trying to sign in with a non-primary user, and the third party provider does not verify their email, and their exists a primary user with the same email. This can also happen the other way around wherein the user is trying to sign in with the primary user (unverified email), and there exists a non-primary user with the same email. 
    - API Path is `/signinup POST`.
    - Output JSON:
        ```json
        {
            "status": "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED",
            "reason": "Cannot sign in / up due to security reasons. Please contact support. (ERR_CODE_024)"
        }
        ```
- You can resolve this by deleting the (non primary) user that has the same email ID, or by manually marking the email of the user as verified for the login method that they are trying to sign in with.

#### Changing the error message on the frontend

If you want to display a different message to the user, or use a different status code, you can change them on the frontend via [the language translation feature](/docs/references/frontend-sdks/prebuilt-ui/translations).
