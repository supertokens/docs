# User management

## Overview

Account linking is the process of associating multiple authentication methods with the same account.
For example, a user may have a password-based account and a Google account. They may want to link both of these accounts to the same user account in your application.

Account linking can occur either automatically or manually.
The first method happens during user sign up.
If a user signs up with a second login method with the same email or phone, the two accounts are automatically linked.
The other one involves you setting up the linking process yourself.
