# Backend SDKs

## Overview

SuperTokens has support for Node.js, Python, and Golang through its backend SDKs.
Use this page to find references to each of them and about specific functionalities.

## SDK configuration

The `appInfo` object is the paramter used to configure the SDKs during initialization.
```ts
let appInfo: {
    appName: string,
    websiteDomain: string,
    apiDomain: string,
    websiteBasePath?: string,  
    apiBasePath?: string,  
    apiGatewayPath?: string 
}
```

<Accordion px="4" pb="4">

## `appName` 

This is the name of your application.
Use it when sending password reset or email verification emails (in the default email design).
An example of this is `appName: "GitHub"`.

<br/>

## `websiteDomain` 

This is the domain part of your website.
This is where the login UI appears.
For example:
- For local development, you are likely using `localhost` with some port (ex `8080`). Then the value of this should be `"http://localhost:8080"`.
- If your website is `https://www.example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://www.example.com"`.
- If your website is `https://example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://example.com"`.
- If you have multiple sub domains, and your users login via `https://auth.example.com`, then the value of this should be `"https://auth.example.com"`.

By default, the login UI appears on `{websiteDomain}/auth/*`. You can change this by using the `websiteBasePath` configuration.

On the frontend, you need the domain for routing purposes, and on the backend, it generates correct email verification and password reset links.

<br/>

## `apiDomain` 

This is the domain part of your API endpoint that the frontend talks to. For example:
- For local development, you are likely using `localhost` with some port (ex `9000`). Then the value of this should be `"http://localhost:9000"`.
- If your frontend queries `https://api.example.com/*`, then the value of this should be `"https://api.example.com"`
- If your API endpoint reaches `/api/*`, then the value of this is the same as the `websiteDomain` - since `/api/*` is equal to querying `{websiteDomain}/api/*`.

By default, the login widgets query `{apiDomain}/auth/*`. You can change this by using the `apiBasePath` configuration.

<br/>

## `websiteBasePath` 

By default, the login UI appears on `{websiteDomain}/auth`. Other authentication-related user interfaces appear on `{websiteDomain}/auth/*`.

If you want to change the `/auth` to something else, then you must set this value. For example:
- If you want the login UI to show on `{websiteDomain}/user/*`, then the value of this should be `"/user"`.
- If you are using a dedicated sub domain for auth, like `https://auth.example.com`, then you probably want the login UI to show up on `https://auth.example.com`. In this case, set this value to `"/"`.

:::important
Remember to set the same value for this parameter on the backend and the frontend.
:::

<br/>


## `apiBasePath` 

By default, the frontend SDK queries `{apiDomain}/auth/*`.

If you want to change the `/auth` to something else, then you must set this value. For example:
- If you have versioning in your API path and want to query `{apiDomain}/v0/auth/*`, then the value of this should be `"/v0/auth"`.
- If you want to scope the APIs not via `/auth` but via some other string like `/supertokens`, then you can set the value of this to `"/supertokens"`. This means, the APIs appear on `{apiDomain}/supertokens/*`.
- If you do not want to scope the APIs at all, then you can set the values of this to be `"/"`. This means the APIs are available on `{apiDomain}/*`

:::important
Remember to set the same value for this parameter on the backend and the frontend.
:::

:::caution
Note that setting a custom `apiBasePath` updates the refresh API path, this can cause an issue where previously issued refresh tokens no longer get sent to the new API endpoint and the user logs out.
For example, the default `apiBasePath` value is `/auth`, if it changes to `/supertokens`, then your refresh endpoint updates from `/auth/session/refresh` to `/supertokens/session/refresh`.
Previously issued refresh tokens do not get sent to the new API endpoint and the user logs out.

## `apiGatewayPath` 

:::note
Most relevant if you are using an API gateway or reverse proxy
:::

If you are using an API gateway (like the one provided by AWS) or a reverse proxy (like Nginx), it may add a path to your API endpoints to scope them for different development environments.
For example, your APIs for development appear via `{apiDomain}/dev/*`, and for production, they may appear via `{apiDomain}/prod/*`.

Whilst the frontend would need to use the `/dev/` and `/prod/`, your backend code would not see that sub path (that is `/dev/` and `/prod/` because the gateway removes them). 

For these situations, you should set the `apiGatewayPath` to `/dev` or `/prod`. For example:
- If your API gateway is using `/development` for scoping, and you want to expose the SuperTokens APIs on `/supertokens/*`, then set `apiGatewayPath: "/development"` & `apiBasePath: "/supertokens"`.
This means that the frontend SDK queries `{apiDomain}/development/supertokens/*` to reach the endpoints exposed by the service.
- If you set this and not `apiBasePath`, then the frontend SDK queries `{apiDomain}{apiGatewayPath}/auth/*` to reach the endpoints exposed by the service.

The reason for this distinction between `apiGatewayPath` and `apiBasePath` is that when routing, the backend SDK does not see the `apiGatewayPath` path from the request because the gateway removes them.
Taking the above example, whilst the frontend queries `{apiDomain}/development/supertokens/*`, the backend SDK sees `{apiDomain}/supertokens/*`.
