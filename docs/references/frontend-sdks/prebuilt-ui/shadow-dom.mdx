## Overview

SuperTokens uses [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to prevent CSS clashes between your CSS and the ones provided by SuperTokens.
This guarantees that all the prebuilt UI renders as expected.

However, this has a few problems:
- You cannot override the prebuilt UI CSS directly through your CSS files.
You need to use JavaScript to achieve this.
- Password managers may not work for your end user.

## Before you start

:::caution no-title
This example is relevant only if you use the prebuilt UI components.

## Example

If you want to disable use of shadow dom, you can do this like:

<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs>
<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    useShadowDom: false,
    recipeList: [/* ... */]
});
```
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem>

<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem value="angular">

```tsx
// this goes in the auth route config of your frontend app (once the pre-built UI script has been loaded)
import {init as supertokensUIInit} from "supertokens-auth-react-script";

supertokensUIInit({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    useShadowDom: false,
    recipeList: [/* ... */]
});
```
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem>
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs>

:::caution
If disabled, please be sure to check that the components render correctly - because your CSS might affect the components' UI (the other way around does not happen).
