Protecting a website route means that it cannot be accessed unless a user is signed in. If a non signed in user tries to access it, they will be redirected to the login page.

Let's say we want to protect the home page of your website (`/` route). In this case, we can edit the `/pages/index.tsx` file to add an auth wrapper around your `Home` component like so:

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
import { SessionAuth } from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session'
// @ts-ignore
import ProtectedPage from "./protectedPage";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    // we protect ProtectedPage by wrapping it with SessionAuth
    <SessionAuth>
      <ProtectedPage />
    </SessionAuth>
  )
}
```

:::tip Test by navigating to `/`
You should be redirected to the login page. After that, sign in, and then visit `/` again. This time, there should be no redirection.

Protecting a website route means that it cannot be accessed unless a user is signed in. If a non signed in user tries to access it, they will be redirected to the login page.

You can do this by using the `doesSessionExist` function as shown below

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import Session from 'supertokens-web-js/recipe/session';

async function doesSessionExist() {
    if (await Session.doesSessionExist()) {
        // user is logged in
    } else {
        // user has not logged in yet
    }
}
```
