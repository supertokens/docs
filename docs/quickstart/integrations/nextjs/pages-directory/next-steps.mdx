    }} defaultAnswer="Yes">
<Answer title="Yes">

You need to now setup an instance of the SuperTokens core for your app (that your backend should connect to). You have two options:
- [Managed service](/docs/quickstart/next-steps#configure-the-core-service)
- [Self hosted](/docs/deployment/self-host-supertokens)
