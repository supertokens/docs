# Introduction

## Overview

This quickstart will guide you through how to set up a basic project that uses **SuperTokens** to authenticate users.
The tutorial shows an **Email/Password** login flow, rendered by either our **Prebuilt UI components** or by your own **Custom UI**.

<RemoveForLLMs>
If you want to skip straight to an example application you can choose between:

- Checking our live [demo application](https://emailpassword.demo.supertokens.com/auth)
- Running a **SuperTokens** project from your local machine. You just have to use our CLI app and execute the following command:

```bash
npx create-supertokens-app@latest --recipe=emailpassword
```

## Before you start

Before going into the actual tutorial, let's get a clear picture of how **SuperTokens** works and some of the terms that we will use throughout the documentation.

### SuperTokens Core

The main service that provides all the functionality is called the **SuperTokens Core**. SDKs communicate over an API with this service in order to
perform authentication related tasks.

Unlike with other providers, the **SuperTokens Frontend SDK** never talks to the **Authentication Service** directly.
All the requests target your existing **Backend Service**.
From there, the **Backend SDKs** are used to expose new authentication routes. Those in turn communicate with the **SuperTokens Core**.

You can check the following diagram for a high level overview of how the services will interact within an authentication setup that involves **SuperTokens**.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ms"
  values={[
    { label: "Managed service", value: "ms" },
    { label: "Self hosted", value: "ss" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="ms">
    <img
      src="/img/architecture/managed_service_without_dashboard.png"
      alt="Flowchart of architecture when using SuperTokens managed service"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ss">
    <img
      src="/img/architecture/self_hosted_without_dashboard.png"
      alt="Flowchart of architecture when self-hosting SuperTokens"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Edge Cases

- You can also host the **SuperTokens Core** yourself. In that case your backend will communicate with a service that exists inside your infrastructure.
- If you are using a backend for which we do not have an SDK, you will have to spin up an additional auth service in a language for which we do have a backend SDK (NodeJS, Python or Golang).

### Recipes

The functionalities that **SuperTokens** provides are bundled into objects that can be referred to as **Recipes**.
Everything from _authentication methods_ to _session and user management_ can be included under this concept.
In the following sections, we will see how recipes get initialised and configured and how you can customise them to fit your use case.

Now that we have cleared all this out, we can move forward with the actual tutorial.
Go to the next page to see how to configure your [Frontend Application](./frontend-setup).
