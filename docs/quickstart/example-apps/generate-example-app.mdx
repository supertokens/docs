# Example App


## Overview

The fastest way to run a quick demo of **SuperTokens** is to use our example app.
You will get a quick understanding of how the authentication experience works and the overall setup of a project.


<ExampleAppForm />



## Project Structure

The command will create a new folder based on the application name that you have specified.
Inside it you will find a project configured to support an authentication flow based on the recipe that you have chosen.
