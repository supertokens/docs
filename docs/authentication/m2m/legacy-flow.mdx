# Legacy flow

## Overview

This custom flow makes use of the **SuperTokens Core** without adhering to the **OAuth2** standard.
It involves creating private access tokens and passing them to the microservices.

The authentication sequence works in the following way:

<Steps>
  ## Microservice `M1` requests a JWT (JSON Web Token) from the **SuperTokens Core**
  ## Microservice `M1` sends the JWT to `M2`
  ## Microservice `M2` verifies the JWT and completes the action if the JWT is valid
</Steps>

<img src="/img/microservice_auth/architecture.png" alt="Microservice auth flow diagram" />

The first step is to create a JWT from the microservice that sends the request (refer to this microservice as `M1`).
Other microservices verify this JWT when `M1` sends them a request.
Since this JWT remains static per microservice, the best time to create this is on process starts - that is when `M1` starts.

The JWT can contain any information you like. At a minimum, it needs to contain information proving that it is a microservice allowed to query other microservices in your infrastructure.
This is necessary since you may issue a JWT to an end user as well, and they should not be able to query any microservice directly.
Add the following claim in the JWT to "mark" the JWT as one meant for microservice auth only:
```json
{..., "source": "microservice", ...}
```
In the receiving microservice (`M2`), verify the JWT and check that this claim is present before serving the request.


### Security considerations

#### Who can query the microservices?
Anyone or any service that has direct access to the SuperTokens core can produce a valid JWT and query your microservices.
If the core is open to the internet, you *must* add an API key to protect it.
Even though end users may receive a JWT for their session (that the core signs), they cannot query a microservice directly. Their JWT *should* not have the `source: "microservice"` claim in it.

#### What happens if someone compromises the core's API key?

Then the attacker can issue their own JWTs to be able to query your microservices. To limit this protection, you may want to add firewall rules to allow access to the core only from services on your backend.
You can also provide multiple API keys to the core and give a unique key to each microservice in your infrastructure. This way, it would be easier to track where a leak came from.

#### What happens if someone compromises the JWT signing key?

In this case, the attacker could fabricate their own JWT to be able to query your microservices.
To limit this risk, a JWT signing key rotation methodology is in place. Until then, you can limit the reachability of your microservices based on the request's IP address.

#### How to limit which microservice can query another one?

If an organisation has multiple teams and microservices, it is common to limit which other services a given microservice can query.
For example, if there exists `M1`, `M2` and `M3` microservices, there may be a situation in which `M1` should only be able to query `M2` and not `M3`.
With one SuperTokens core deployment, having this type of restriction is impossible. All the microservices create and verify their JWTs using the same public/private keys. Therefore `M3` receives a request, it has no way of reliably knowing if the request is from `M1` or `M2` (assuming that IP-based access control is not implemented).
This type of restriction can occur by deploying multiple cores connected to their own databases. In this example, a dedicated SuperTokens core can handle `M3`'s auth, such that only `M3` uses that to verify the incoming JWTs. Then, only other services that have access to that core can create JWTs that `M3` accepts. If `M1` doesn't have access to `M3`'s core's API key, it can be assured that successful requests to `M3` are not from `M1`.


## Steps

### 1. Create a JWT

<Question question="Are you using the SuperTokens SDK?" defaultAnswer="Yes">

<Answer title="Yes">

First, initialize the `JWT` recipe in the `supertokens.init` function call:

<BackendTabs>

<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import supertokens from "supertokens-node"
import jwt from "supertokens-node/recipe/jwt"

supertokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    supertokens: {
        connectionURI: "...", // location of the core
        apiKey: "..." // provide the core's API key if configured
    },
    recipeList: [
        // highlight-next-line
        jwt.init()
    ]
})
```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="go">

```go
import (
	"github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/recipe/jwt"
	"github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang/supertokens"
)

func main() {
	supertokens.Init(supertokens.TypeInput{
        AppInfo: supertokens.AppInfo{
            AppName: "...",
            WebsiteDomain: "...",
            APIDomain: "...",
        },
        Supertokens: &supertokens.ConnectionInfo{
            ConnectionURI: "...", // location of the core
            APIKey: "...", // provide the core's API key if configured
        },
		RecipeList: []supertokens.Recipe{
            // highlight-next-line
			jwt.Init(nil),
		},
	})
}
```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="python">

```python
from supertokens_python import init, InputAppInfo, SupertokensConfig
from supertokens_python.recipe import jwt

init(
    app_info=InputAppInfo(
        app_name="...",
        api_domain="...",
        website_domain="...",
    ),
    supertokens_config=SupertokensConfig(
        connection_uri="...", # location of the core
        api_key="..." # provide the core's API key if configured
    ),
    framework='django',
    recipe_list=[
        # highlight-next-line
        jwt.init(),
    ],
)
```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
</BackendTabs>

:::important
- The value of `apiDomain` should be the domain part of the JWKS URL used to verify the JWT (from `M2`). This should ideally be the domain of the microservice that has all the other SuperTokens' recipes initialized in them.
- If this microservice does not initialize any other recipe, the values of `appName` and `websiteDomain` don't matter.
:::

After this, you can use the JWT recipe to create your own JWT whenever required:

<BackendTabs isSubTab={true}>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import jwt from "supertokens-node/recipe/jwt"

async function createJWT(payload: any) {
    let jwtResponse = await jwt.createJWT({

        source: "microservice"
    });
    if (jwtResponse.status === "OK") {
        // Send JWT as Authorization header to M2
        return jwtResponse.jwt;
    }
    throw new Error("Unable to create JWT. Should never come here.")
}
```

		// ...additional payload

	if err != nil {
		// handle error

	jwtString := jwtResponse.OK.Jwt
	fmt.Println(jwtString)

:::note
By default, the lifetime of the JWT is a 100 years. You can pass a second argument to the `createJWT` function indicating a custom lifetime (in seconds) for the JWT.
:::

:::note
By default, the JWT uses a static key for signing, not subject to the key rotation normally applied to access tokens. You can pass `false` as the third argument to the `createJWT` function to use the dynamic keys.
:::

</Answer>

<Answer title="No">

You can send a `HTTP` request to the core as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '${connectionURI}/recipe/jwt' \
--header 'rid: jwt' \
--header 'api-key: ${APIKey}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "payload": {
    "source": "microservice",
    ...
  },
  "useStaticSigningKey": true,
  "algorithm": "RS256",
  "jwksDomain": "${apiDomain}",
  "validity": ${validityInSeconds}
}'
```
- The value of `${connectionURI}` is the core's location
- `${APIKey}` is the API key to query the core. This is only needed if an API key exists on the core.
- The value of `${apiDomain}` is the domain on which the JWKs URLs are available from
- `${validityInSeconds}` is the lifetime of the JWT

An example response is as follows:
```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "jwt": "eyJraWQiOiI0YTE...rCFPcIRgzu_bChIIpFdA"
}

```

</Answer>

</Question>

### 2. Store the JWT

Once you create the JWT, you can store it in a (globally accessible) variable and access it when you want to talk to a microservice.
Add the JWT as an `Authorization: Bearer` token like this:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://microservice_location/path' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI0YTE...rCFPcIRgzu_bChIIpFdA' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "request": "payload"
}'
```

### 3. Verify JWTs

<AppInfoForm />

When a target microservice receives a JWT, it must first verify it before proceeding to serve the request. The process involves two steps:
- A standard verification of the JWT
- Checking the JWT claim to make sure that another microservice has queried it.

#### Using JWKS endpoint

<BackendTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true}>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

##### Get JWKS endpoint

The JWKS endpoint is `^{appInfo.apiDomain}/^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json`. Here the `apiDomain` and `apiBasePath` are values pointing to the server in which you have initialized SuperTokens using the backend SDK.

##### Verify the JWT

Some libraries let you provide a JWKS endpoint to verify a JWT. For example for NodeJS you can use `jsonwebtoken` and `jwks-rsa` together to achieve this.

```ts
import JsonWebToken, { JwtHeader, SigningKeyCallback } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';

var client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'
});

function getKey(header: JwtHeader, callback: SigningKeyCallback) {
  client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function (err, key) {
    var signingKey = key!.getPublicKey();
    callback(err, signingKey);
  });
}

let jwt = "...";
JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, getKey, {}, function (err, decoded) {
  let decodedJWT = decoded;
  // Use JWT
});
```

Refer to this [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/rishabhpoddar/ea31502923ec9a53136371f2b6317ffa) for a code reference of how use `PyJWK` to do JWT verification. The gist contains two files:
- `jwt_verification.py` (which you can copy/paste into your application). You have to modify the `JWKS_URI` in this file to point to your SuperTokens core instance (replacing the `try.supertokens.com` part of the URL). This file is for `sync` python apps, and you can modify it to work with `async` apps as well.
  - This file essentially exposes a function called `verify_jwt` which takes an input JWT string.
  - This function takes care of caching public keys in memory + auto `refetching` if the public keys have changed (which happens automatically every 24 hours with SuperTokens). This does not cause any user logouts, and is just a security feature.
- `views.py`: This is an example `GET` API which extracts the JWT token from the authorization header in the request and calls the `verify_jwt` function from the other file.

#### Using public key string

<BackendTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true}>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

Some JWT verification libraries require you to provide the JWT secret / public key for verification. You can obtain the JWT secret from SuperTokens in the following way:

- First, query the `JWKS.json` endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl --location --request GET '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'

  {
    "keys": [
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "kid": "s-2de612a5-a5ba-413e-9216-4c43e2e78c86",
        "n": "AMZruthvYz7Ft-Dp0BC_SEEJaWK91s_YA-RR81iLJ6BTT6gJp0CcV4DfBynFU_59dRGOZyVQpAW6Drnc_6LyZpVWHROzqt-Fjh8TAqodayhPJVuZt25eQiYrqcaK_dnuHrm8qwUq-hko6q1o9NIIZWNfUBEVWmNhyAJFk5bi3pLwtKPYrUQzVLcTdDUe4SIltvvfpYHbVFnYtxkBVmqO68j7sI8ktmTXM_heals-W6WmozabDkC9_ITCeRat2f7A2l0t4QzO0ZCzZcJfhusF4X1niKgY6yYXpbX6is4HCfhYfdabcE52xYMNl-gw9XDjsIxfBMUDvOFRHWlx0rU8c=",
        "e": "AQAB",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "use": "sig"
      },
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "kid": "d-230...802340",
        "n": "AMZruthvYz7...lx0rU8c=",
        "e": "...",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "use": "sig"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  :::important
  The above shows an example output which returns two keys. There could be more keys returned based on the configured key rotation setting in the core. If you notice, each key's `kid` starts with a `s-..` or a `d-..`. The `s-..` key is a static key that never changes, whereas `d-...` keys are dynamic keys that keep changing. If you are `hardcoding` public keys somewhere, you always want to pick the `s-..` key.
  :::

- Next, run the NodeJS script below to convert the above output to a `PEM` file format.
  ```tsx
  import jwkToPem from 'jwk-to-pem';

  // This JWK is copied from the result of the above SuperTokens core request
  let jwk = {
    "kty": "RSA",
    "kid": "s-2de612a5-a5ba-413e-9216-4c43e2e78c86",
    "n": "AMZruthvYz7Ft-Dp0BC_SEEJaWK91s_YA-RR81iLJ6BTT6gJp0CcV4DfBynFU_59dRGOZyVQpAW6Drnc_6LyZpVWHROzqt-Fjh8TAqodayhPJVuZt25eQiYrqcaK_dnuHrm8qwUq-hko6q1o9NIIZWNfUBEVWmNhyAJFk5bi3pLwtKPYrUQzVLcTdDUe4SIltvvfpYHbVFnYtxkBVmqO68j7sI8ktmTXM_heals-W6WmozabDkC9_ITCeRat2f7A2l0t4QzO0ZCzZcJfhusF4X1niKgY6yYXpbX6is4HCfhYfdabcE52xYMNl-gw9XDjsIxfBMUDvOFRHWlx0rU8c=",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "use": "sig"
  };

  // @ts-ignore
  let certString = jwkToPem(jwk);
  ```

  The above snippet would generate the following certificate string:

  ```text
  -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxmu62G9jPsW34OnQEL9I
  QQlpYr3Wz9gD5FHzWIsnoFNPqAmnQJxXgN8HKcVT/n11EY5nJVCkBboOudz/ovJm
  ... (truncated for display)
  XhfWeIqBjrJheltfqKzgcJ+Fh91ptwTnbFgw2X6DD1cOOwjF8ExQO84VEdaXHStT
  xwIDAQAB
  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  ```

- You can use the generated PEM string in your code like shown below:
  ```ts
  import JsonWebToken from 'jsonwebtoken';

  // Truncated for display
  let certificate = "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nnMIIBIjANBgkqhki...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----";
  let jwt = "..."; // fetch the JWT from sAccessToken cookie or Authorization Bearer header
  JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, certificate, function (err, decoded) {
      let decodedJWT = decoded;
      // Use JWT
  });
  ```

#### Claim verification

The second step is to get the JWT payload and check that it has the `"source": "microservice"` claim:

<BackendTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true}>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import JsonWebToken, { JwtHeader, SigningKeyCallback } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';

var client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'
});

function getKey(header: JwtHeader, callback: SigningKeyCallback) {
  client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function (err, key) {
    var signingKey = key!.getPublicKey();
    callback(err, signingKey);
  });
}

let jwt = "...";
JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, getKey, {}, function (err, decoded) {
  // highlight-start
  let decodedJWT = decoded;
  if (decodedJWT === undefined || typeof decodedJWT === "string" || decodedJWT.source === undefined || decodedJWT.source !== "microservice") {
    // return a 401 unauthorised error
  } else {
    // handle API request...
  }
  // highlight-end
});
```

</BackendTabs.TabItem>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="python">

Referring once again to this [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/rishabhpoddar/ea31502923ec9a53136371f2b6317ffa), in `views.py`, between lines 20 and 28, the value of a certain claim in the decoded JWT payload undergoes a check. You can do something similar and check for the `source` claim whose value must be `microservice`. If it is, then all's good, else you can return a 401.

#### M2M and frontend session verification for the same API
You may have a setup wherein the same API receives calls from the frontend as well as from other microservices. The frontend session works differently than m2m sessions, therefore both forms of token inputs must be accounted for.

The approach here would be to first attempt frontend session verification, and if that fails, then attempt m2m JWT verification (using the above method). If both fail, then send back a `401` response.

The [`getSession` function](https://supertokens.com/docs/session/common-customizations/sessions/session-verification-in-api/get-session) serves for frontend session verification.

<BackendTabs disableOtherFrameworks={true}>
<BackendTabs.TabItem value="nodejs">

```tsx
import express from "express";
import Session from "supertokens-node/recipe/session";
import JsonWebToken, { JwtHeader, SigningKeyCallback } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';

let app = express();


var client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json'
});

function getKey(header: JwtHeader, callback: SigningKeyCallback) {
  client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function (err, key) {
    var signingKey = key!.getPublicKey();
    callback(err, signingKey);
  });
}


app.post("/like-comment", async (req, res, next) => {
  // highlight-start
    try {
        let session = await Session.getSession(req, res, { sessionRequired: false })

        if (session !== undefined) {
            // API call from the frontend and session verification is successful..
            let userId = session.getUserId();
        } else {
            // maybe this API is called from a microservice, so we attempt JWT verification as
            // shown above.
            let jwt = req.headers["authorization"];
            jwt = jwt === undefined ? undefined : jwt.split('Bearer ')[1];
            if (jwt === undefined) {
                // return a 401 unauthorised error...
            } else {
                JsonWebToken.verify(jwt, getKey, {}, function (err, decoded) {
                  let decodedJWT = decoded;
                  // microservices auth is successful..
                });
            }
        }
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
  // highlight-end
});
```

- Notice that the `sessionRequired: false` option appears when calling `getSession`. This is because in case the input tokens are from another microservice, then instead of throwing an unauthorised error, the `getSession` function returns `undefined`. It's important to note that if the session does exist, but the access token has expired, the `getSession` function throws a try refresh token error, sending a 401 to the frontend. This triggers a session refresh flow as expected.
- If the `getSession` function returns `undefined`, it means that the session is not from the frontend and a microservice auth verification can occur using the JWT verification method shown previously in this page.
- If that fails too, send back a `401` response.

- Notice that the `sessionRequired: false` option appears when calling `getSession`. This is because in case the input tokens are from another microservice, then instead of throwing an unauthorised error, the `getSession` function returns `nil`. It's important to note that if the session does exist, but the access token has expired, the `getSession` function returns an error, and the `supertokens.ErrorHandler` sends a 401 to the frontend. This triggers a session refresh flow as expected.
- If the `getSession` function returns `nil`, it means that the session is not from the frontend and a microservice auth verification can occur using the JWT verification method shown previously in this page.
- If that fails too, send back a `401` response.
