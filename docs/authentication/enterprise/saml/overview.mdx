# Overview 

`SAML`, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is an open protocol that exchanges information between the auth server and the client application.
Some identity providers require OAuth 2.0 for user login, some require `SAML`, and some can work with both.

## How it works?

Your `SAML` identity provider has a metadata file (`.xml`) that you or your end users need to upload to the `SAML` client.

The `.xml` metadata file contains (amongst other things):
- A unique entity ID that you must keep private. The `SAML` provider uses this to identify your application.
- A public certificate that verifies the signature attached to the incoming `SAML` response.
This ensures the response is coming from the expected Identity Provider.
- Information about where to redirect the end user to when they click on the login button in your application. 
This URL is to a website controlled by the `SAML` provider and asks the end user for their credentials.


## Add SAML login with SuperTokens

SuperTokens is not a `SAML` client.
This means that you have to use a third-party solution along with SuperTokens to integrate with a `SAML` provider.
The way this works is that the third-party solution acts as an OAuth 2.0 provider to SuperTokens, and a `SAML` client to the `SAML` provider:

### BoxyHQ

[BoxyHQ](https://boxyhq.com/) is a commercial open-source company that has a product called "SAML Jackson" which helps integrate `SAML` providers into your application.

`SAML` Jackson is a perfect fit with SuperTokens because:
- It's an OAuth provider and a `SAML` client.
This fits with the architecture.
- For self hosted, it supports PostgreSQL and MySQL amongst [other databases](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/service#database).
Self hosted SuperTokens only supports PostgreSQL as a data source.

`SAML` Jackson provides an HTTP service that you can host yourself or let BoxyHQ manage.
The HTTP service uses NodeJS, and is embeddable within your NodeJS backend.
However, because SuperTokens supports multiple backends, the focus is on deploying `SAML` Jackson as a microservice.

1. The user clicks on the login button and redirects to `SAML` Jackson's microservice at `http://localhost:5225/api/oauth/authorize`
2. `SAML` Jackson redirects the user to the `SAML` provider's login page where the user needs to enter their credentials
3. After successfully authenticating the user, the `SAML` provider redirects the user to `SAML` Jackson. Step (2) and (3) follow the `SAML` protocol.
4. `SAML` Jackson redirects the user to the frontend app on the configured callback URL. The callback URL contains the one-time use auth code.
5. SuperTokens' frontend `SDK` passes the one-time use auth code to your app's backend.
6. SuperTokens' backend `SDK` verifies the auth code by querying `SAML` Jackson. On success, `SAML` Jackson returns the end user's information and access token.
7. SuperTokens' backend `SDK` creates a new user in the core associated with the end user's email. New session tokens are also created
8. A SuperTokens' session establishes between your app's backend and frontend - logging in the user.

:::info Example App
An [example app on GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/jackson-supertokens-express) with SuperTokens + `SAML` Jackson, for React and NodeJS express apps, is available. This uses [mocksaml.com](https://mocksaml.com/) as a `SAML` provider
