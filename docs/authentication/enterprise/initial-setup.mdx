# Initial setup

## Before you start

<PaidFeatureCallout />

These instructions assume that you already have gone through the main [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/introduction).
If you have skipped that page please follow the tutorial and return here once you're done.

## Steps

### 1. Create a tenant 

The first step in setting up a multi tenant login system is to create a tenant in the SuperTokens core.
Each tenant has a unique `tenantId` mapped to that tenant's configuation.
The `tenantId` could be that tenant's sub domain, or a workspace URL, or anything else that can help identify them.

The configuration mapped to each tenant contains information about which login methods they enable.

#### Configure third party providers 

If you are using the `thirdparty` recipe on a tenant, you also need to set the providers that you want to use with it.
There's an extensive list of [built-in providers](/docs/authentication/social/built-in-providers-config), but you can also configure [a custom provider](/docs/authentication/enterprise/manage-tenants).

The next code snippet shows how you can add an Active Directory login to your tenant.
Update the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `directoryId` based on your tenant configuration.

<AddProviderConfigurationBlock />

### 2. Provide additional configuration per tenant

You can also configure a tenant to use different settings. 
The next sample shows you how to customize the values.

<UpdateTenantConfigBlock />

### 3. View tenant details 

To view the configuration for a specific tenant you can use an SDK method or call the API directly.

<GetTenantBlock />

### 4. Set up the user interface

To allow users to authenticate using one of your previously created tenants you need to update your frontend application.
You can do this in two ways: [through a common domain](/docs/authentication/enterprise/common-domain-login), [through subdomains](/docs/authentication/enterprise/subdomain-login).

Explore the two guides for a full list of instructions on how to implement the flows.
