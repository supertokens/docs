### Fetching the OAuth/Access tokens on the frontend

1. Sign in with the social provider. The minimum required scope is the one that provides access to the user's email. You can use any library to sign in with the social provider.
2. Get the access token on the frontend if it is available.
3. Get the id token from the sign in result if it is available.

:::important
You need to provide either the access token or the id token, or both in step 2, depending on what is available.

### Calling the `signinup` API to use the OAuth tokens


Once you have the `access_token` or the `id_token` from the auth provider, you need to call the `/signinup` API exposed by the backend `SDK` as shown below:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "thirdPartyId": "google",
    "clientType": "...",
    "oAuthTokens": {
        "access_token": "...",
        "id_token": "..."
    },
}'
```

:::important
- The `clientType` input is optional, and you need it only if you have initialised more than one client in the provide on the backend (See the "Social / Single Sign-On login for both, web and mobile apps" section below).
- If you have the `id_token`, you can send that along with the `access_token`.
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user.
- `status: "NO_EMAIL_GIVEN_BY_PROVIDER"`: This occurs if the social / Single Sign-On provider did not provide an email for the user. In this case, you want to ask the user to pick another method of sign in. Or, you can also override the backend functions to create a fake email for the user for this provider.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is only possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should display on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during `MFA`. The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in / up was not allowed.

:::note
On success, the backend sends back session tokens as part of the response headers which are automatically handled by the frontend `SDK` for you.
