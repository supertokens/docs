The following section shows you what aspects you need to cover to implement the UI for a `Magic Link` flow.
The same flow applies during either sign up or sign in.
This guide shows you how to determine if the system creates a new user in the next steps.

#### 2.1 Sending the Magic link

You need to add a form that asks the user for their email address or phone number.
When the user submits the form, you need to call the following API to create and send them a **Magic Link**.

You configure the contact method on the next page, where you discuss the process of adding the `SDK` to your backend app.

For email based login

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup/code' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"
}'
```

For phone number based login
```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup/code' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
}'
```


The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: This means that the magic link was successfully sent.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should display on the frontend, or if the input email or password failed the backend validation logic.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during multi-factor authentication (MFA). The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in / up was not allowed.

The response from the API call is the following object (in case of `status: "OK"`):
```json
{
    status: "OK";
    deviceId: string;
    preAuthSessionId: string;
    flowType: "USER_INPUT_CODE" | "MAGIC_LINK" | "USER_INPUT_CODE_AND_MAGIC_LINK";
    fetchResponse: Response; // raw fetch response from the API call
}
```

You want to save the `deviceId` and `preAuthSessionId` on the frontend storage. These are useful to:
- Resend a new magic link.
- Detect if the user has already sent a magic link before or if this is an entirely new login attempt. This distinction can be important if you have different UI for these two states. For example, if this info already exists, you do not want to show the user an input box to enter their email / phone, and instead want to show them the resend link button.

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

</FrontendCustomUITabs>

#### 2.2 Resending a magic link

After sending the initial magic link to the user, you may want to display a resend button to them.
When the user clicks on this button, you should call the following API

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptsCard>

```tsx

            // this can happen if the user has already successfully logged in into
            // another device whilst also trying to login to this one.

            // we clear the login attempt info that was added when the createCode function 
            // was called - so that if the user does a page reload, they will now see the 
            // enter email / phone UI again.
            await clearLoginAttemptInfo();
            window.alert("Login failed. Please try again");
            window.location.assign("/auth")
        } else {
            // Magic link resent successfully.
            window.alert("Please check your email for the magic link");
        }
    } catch (err: any) {
        if (err.isSuperTokensGeneralError === true) {
            // this may be a custom error message sent from the API by you.

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: This means that the magic link was successfully sent.
- `status: "RESTART_FLOW_ERROR"`: This can happen if the user has already successfully logged in into another device whilst also trying to login to this one. You want to take the user back to the login screen where they can enter their email / phone number again. Be sure to remove the stored `deviceId` and `preAuthSessionId` from the frontend storage.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should display on the frontend.

</FrontendCustomUITabs>

#### How to detect if the user is on step 2.1 or step 2.2?

If you are building the UI for both of the previous steps on the same page you might run into an issue when the user refreshes the page.
To prevent this you need a way to know which UI to show.

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptsCard>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="npm">

```tsx
import { getLoginAttemptInfo } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/passwordless";

async function hasInitialMagicLinkBeenSent() {
    return await getLoginAttemptInfo() !== undefined;
}
```

</NpmOrScriptsCard.Content>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="scripts">

```tsx
import supertokensPasswordless from "supertokens-web-js-script/recipe/passwordless";
async function hasInitialMagicLinkBeenSent() {
    return await supertokensPasswordless.getLoginAttemptInfo() !== undefined;
}
```

</NpmOrScriptsCard.Content>
</NpmOrScriptsCard>

If `hasInitialMagicLinkBeenSent` returns `true`, it means that the user has already sent the initial magic link to themselves, and you can show the resend link UI. Else show a form asking them to enter their email / phone number.

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="mobile">

Since you save the `preAuthSessionId` and `deviceId` after sending the initial magic link, you can know if the user is on either **step 3.1** or **step 3.2**. Check if these tokens are on the device.

If they aren't, you should follow **step 3.1**, else follow **step 3.2**.

:::important
You need to clear these tokens if:
- the user navigates away from the **step 3.2** page
- you get a `RESTART_FLOW_ERROR` at any point in time from an API call
- the user has successfully logged in.

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

</FrontendCustomUITabs>

#### 2.3 Consuming the magic link

When a user clicks on a magic link, you first need to know if the action came from the same browser/device as the one that started the flow.
To do this you ca use this code sample.

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptsCard>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="npm">

```tsx
import { getLoginAttemptInfo } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/passwordless";

async function isThisSameBrowserAndDevice() {
    return await getLoginAttemptInfo() !== undefined;
}
```

</NpmOrScriptsCard.Content>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="scripts">

```tsx
import supertokensPasswordless from "supertokens-web-js-script/recipe/passwordless";
async function isThisSameBrowserAndDevice() {
    return await supertokensPasswordless.getLoginAttemptInfo() !== undefined;
}
```

</NpmOrScriptsCard.Content>
</NpmOrScriptsCard>

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="mobile">

Since you save the `preAuthSessionId` and `deviceId`, you can check if they exist on the app. If they do, then it's the same device that the user has opened the link on, else it's a different device.

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

</FrontendCustomUITabs>

:::important

Add a intermediate step if the user came from a different device.

:::

If the user clicked on a link from a different device, you need to show some kind of an intermediate UI.
This is to protect against email clients opening the magic link on their servers and consuming the link.

The page should require additional user interaction before consuming the magic link.
For example, you could show a button with the following text: `Click here to login into this device`.
On click, you can consume the magic link to log the user into that device.

With this understanding of how to avoid potential errors, proceed with the actual instructions on how to authenticate with the magic link.

You need to remove the `linkCode` and `preAuthSessionId` from the Magic link. For example, if the Magic link is 

```text
https://example.com/auth/verify?preAuthSessionId=PyIwyA6VjdjNF5ggMV960rs3QXupRP2PEg2KcN5oi8s=#s4hxpBPnRC3xwBsCkFU228lh_CWe5HUBMRPowajsrgs=
```

Then the `preAuthSessionId` is the value of the query parameter `preAuthSessionId` (`PyIwyA6VjdjNF5ggMV960rs3QXupRP2PEg2KcN5oi8s=` in the example), and the `linkCode` is the part after the `#` (`s4hxpBPnRC3xwBsCkFU228lh_CWe5HUBMRPowajsrgs=` in the example).

We can then use these to call the consume API

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup/code/consume' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "linkCode": "s4hxpBPnRC3xwBsCkFU228lh_CWe5HUBMRPowajsrgs=",
  "preAuthSessionId": "PyIwyA6VjdjNF5ggMV960rs3QXupRP2PEg2KcN5oi8s="
}'
```


:::info Multi Tenancy
For a multi-tenancy setup, the `<TENANT_ID>` value can fetch from the `tenantId` query parameter from the magic link. If it's not there in the link, you can use the value `"public"` (which is the default tenant).
:::

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: User sign in / up was successful. The response also contains more information about the user, for example their user ID, and if it was a new user or existing user. 
- `status: "INCORRECT_USER_INPUT_CODE_ERROR" | "EXPIRED_USER_INPUT_CODE_ERROR" | "RESTART_FLOW_ERROR"`: These responses indicate that the Magic link was invalid or expired.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should display on the frontend.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during multi-factor authentication (MFA). The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in / up was not allowed.
