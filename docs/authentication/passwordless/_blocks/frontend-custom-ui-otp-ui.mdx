The following section shows you what aspects you need to cover to implement the UI for a `OTP`, One-Time Password, flow.
The same flow applies during either sign up or sign in.
This guide shows you how to determine if you create a new user in the next steps.

#### 2.1 Creating and sending the OTP

You have to add a form that asks the user for their email address or phone number.
When the users submit the form you have to call the following API to create and send them an OTP.

```tsx
import { createCode } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/passwordless";

async function sendOTP(email: string) {
    try {
        let response = await createCode({
            email
        });
        /**
         * For phone number, use this:
            
            let response = await createPasswordlessCode({
                phoneNumber: "+1234567890"
            });
         
        */

        if (response.status === "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED") {
            // the reason string is a user friendly message
            // about what went wrong. It can also contain a support code which users
            // can tell you so you know why their sign in / up was not allowed.
            window.alert(response.reason)
        } else {
            // OTP sent successfully.
            window.alert("Please check your email for an OTP");
        }
    } catch (err: any) {
        if (err.isSuperTokensGeneralError === true) {
            // this may be a custom error message sent from the API by you,
            // or if the input email / phone number is not valid.
            window.alert(err.message);
        } else {
            window.alert("Oops! Something went wrong.");
        }
    }
}
```

For email based login

```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup/code' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"
}'
```

For phone number based login
```bash
curl --location --request POST '^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/signinup/code' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
}'
```


The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: This means that the OTP was successfully sent.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should display on the frontend, or if the input email or password failed the backend validation logic.
- `status: "SIGN_IN_UP_NOT_ALLOWED"`: This can happen during automatic account linking or during `MFA`. The `reason` prop that's in the response body contains a support code using which you can see why the sign in / up was not allowed.

The response from the API call is the following object (in case of `status: "OK"`):
```json
{
    status: "OK";
    deviceId: string;
    preAuthSessionId: string;
    flowType: "USER_INPUT_CODE" | "MAGIC_LINK" | "USER_INPUT_CODE_AND_MAGIC_LINK";
    fetchResponse: Response; // raw fetch response from the API call
}
```

You want to save the `deviceId` and `preAuthSessionId` on the frontend storage. These are useful to:
- Resend a new OTP.
- Detect if the user has already sent an OTP before or if this is an entirely new login attempt. This distinction can be important if you have different UI for these two states. For example, if this info already exists, you do not want to show the user an input box to enter their email / phone, and instead want to show them the enter OTP form with a resend button.
- Verify the user's input OTP.

#### 2.2 Resending a OTP

After you send the OTP to the user, you may want to display a resend button to them.
When the user clicks on this button, you should call the following API

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptsCard>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="npm">

```tsx
import { resendCode, clearLoginAttemptInfo } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/passwordless";

async function resendOTP() {
    try {
        let response = await resendCode();

        if (response.status === "RESTART_FLOW_ERROR") {
            // this can happen if the user has already successfully logged in into
            // another device whilst also trying to login to this one.

            // we clear the login attempt info that was added when the createCode function 
            // was called - so that if the user does a page reload, they will now see the 
            // enter email / phone UI again.
            await clearLoginAttemptInfo();
            window.alert("Login failed. Please try again");
            window.location.assign("/auth")
        } else {
            // OTP resent successfully.
            window.alert("Please check your email for the OTP");
        }
    } catch (err: any) {
        if (err.isSuperTokensGeneralError === true) {
            // this may be a custom error message sent from the API by you.
            window.alert(err.message);
        } else {
            window.alert("Oops! Something went wrong.");
        }
    }
}
```

  "preAuthSessionId": "...."
}'
```


The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:
- `status: "OK"`: This means that the OTP was successfully sent.
- `status: "RESTART_FLOW_ERROR"`: This can happen if the user has already successfully logged in into another device whilst also trying to login to this one. You want to take the user back to the login screen where they can enter their email / phone number again. Be sure to remove the stored `deviceId` and `preAuthSessionId` from the frontend storage.
- `status: "GENERAL_ERROR"`: This is possible if you have overridden the backend API to send back a custom error message which should display on the frontend.

#### How to detect if the user is on step 3.1 or step 3.2?

If you are building the UI for both of the previous steps on the same page you might run into an issue when the user refreshes the page.
To prevent this you need a way to know which UI to show.

<FrontendCustomUITabs>
<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="web">

<NpmOrScriptsCard>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="npm">

```tsx
import { getLoginAttemptInfo } from "supertokens-web-js/recipe/passwordless";

async function hasInitialOTPBeenSent() {
    return await getLoginAttemptInfo() !== undefined;
}
```

</NpmOrScriptsCard.Content>
<NpmOrScriptsCard.Content value="scripts">

```tsx
import supertokensPasswordless from "supertokens-web-js-script/recipe/passwordless";
async function hasInitialOTPBeenSent() {
    return await supertokensPasswordless.getLoginAttemptInfo() !== undefined;
}
```

</NpmOrScriptsCard.Content>
</NpmOrScriptsCard>

If `hasInitialOTPBeenSent` returns `true`, it means that the user has already sent the initial OTP to themselves, and you can show the enter OTP form + resend OTP button 3.2. Else show a form asking them to enter their email / phone number 3.1.

</FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem>

<FrontendCustomUITabs.TabItem value="mobile">

Since you save the `preAuthSessionId` and `deviceId` after you send the initial OTP, you can determine if the user is in step 3.1 or 3.2.
Check if you stored these tokens on the device.

If they aren't, you should follow 3.1, else follow 3.2.

:::important
You need to clear these tokens if:
- the user navigates away from the 3.2 page
- you get a `RESTART_FLOW_ERROR` at any point in time from an API call
- the user has successfully logged in.

#### 2.3 Verifying the OTP

When the user enters an OTP you have to call the following API to verify it

            userInputCode: otp

            // we clear the login attempt info that was added when the createCode function 
            // was called since the login was successful.
            await clearLoginAttemptInfo();
            if (response.createdNewRecipeUser && response.user.loginMethods.length === 1) {
                // user sign up success

                // user sign in success

            window.location.assign("/home")
        } else if (response.status === "INCORRECT_USER_INPUT_CODE_ERROR") {
            // the user entered an invalid OTP
            window.alert("Wrong OTP! Please try again. Number of attempts left: " + (response.maximumCodeInputAttempts - response.failedCodeInputAttemptCount));

            // it can come here if the entered OTP was correct, but has expired because
            // it was generated too long ago.
            window.alert("Old OTP entered. Please regenerate a new one and try again");
        } else {
            // this can happen if the user tried an incorrect OTP too many times.

The response body from the API call has a `status` property in it:

- `status: "INCORRECT_USER_INPUT_CODE_ERROR"`: The entered OTP is invalid. The response contains information about the maximum number of retries and the number of failed attempts.
