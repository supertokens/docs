# Unified Login 

## Overview

The **Unified Login** feature helps you in scenarios which involve different types of applications using a common **Authorization Server**.
With it you can configure a common **OAuth2 Provider** that authenticates all your clients.


## Prerequisites

<PaidFeatureCallout />

Before you can dive deeper in the functionality there are a few things to keep in mind: 
- The feature is available with the **SuperTokens Managed Service**.
It is not included in the **Self-Hosted** version.
- You can use it with the `Node.js` or the `Python` backend SDKs.
On `golang` you have to wait for the next releases or configure a separate **Authorization Service**.
- Magic link based login is not supported. However, you can switch to `email`/`SMS` **OTP** instead. This method offers the same level of security.
- *Step Up Authentication* is not available out of the box. You have to use customizations to support the flow.

## Getting started 

Three separate quickstart guides are available for you to follow.
They organize the content based on the specific use case that you want to implement.

Before you explore a guide, read through the **OAuth2 Basics** page first.
It explains concepts used in each tutorial.
