# Reuse website login for desktop and mobile apps


## Overview

This pattern is useful if you want to have the same web authentication experience for your desktop and mobile apps.
The implementation allows you to save development time but keep in mind that it does not involve a native authentication interface.
Users get directed to a separate browser page where they complete the authentication flow and then return to your application.

The authentication flow works in the following way:


<Steps>
## User accesses the native application
 - The user gets redirected to [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/oauth2-basics#authorization-server) authentication URL.
 - The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/oauth2-basics#authorization-server) redirects the user to the login UI

## User completes the login attempt 
 - The [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/oauth2-basics#authorization-server) backend redirects the user to the `callback URL`.
 - This URL should be a deep link that your actual application can open.

## The application uses the callback URL information to request a **OAuth2 Access Token** from the [**Authorization Service**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/oauth2-basics#authorization-server).
 - The application saves the returned token.
</Steps>

## Before you start

<PaidFeatureCallout />

These instructions assume that you already have gone through the main [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/introduction).
If you have skipped that page, please follow the tutorial and return here once you're done.

## Steps

### 1. Enable the Unified Login feature

Go to the [**SuperTokens.com SaaS Dashboard**](https://supertokens.com) and follow these instructions:
1. Click on the **Enabled Paid Features** button
2. Click on **Managed Service**
3. Check the **Unified Login / M2M** option
4. Click *Save* 


### 2. Create the OAuth2 Clients


For each of your applications you need to create a separate [**OAuth2 client**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/oauth2-basics#client).
You can do this by directly calling the **SuperTokens Core** API.


<CreateOAuth2ClientRequest />

:::caution
You have to save the create OAuth2 Client response because this is not persisted internally for security reasons.
The information is necessary for the next steps. 
:::

Based on the client creation process, you can infer two additional values that you need later on:
- `authorizeUrl` corresponds to `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/oauth/auth`
- `tokenFetchUrl` corresponds to `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}/oauth/token`

### 3. Configure the Authorization Service

Check one of the previous guides that show you how to set up the **Authorization Service** and then return to this page.
Choose the tutorial based whether you use multiple backend services or not:
- [Single Backend Setup](/docs/authentication/unified-login/quickstart-guides/multiple-frontends-with-a-single-backend#3-set-up-the-authorization-service-backend)
- [Multiple Backends Setup](/docs/authentication/unified-login/quickstart-guides/multiple-frontends-with-a-single-backend#3-set-up-the-authorization-service-backend)

### 4. Update the login flow in your applications

In each of your individual `applications`, you need to set up logic for handling the **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow.
You can use a generic **OIDC** or **OAuth** library to do this.

<MobileFrameworksCard>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="reactnative">

<MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

You can use the [react-native-app-auth](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-app-auth/) library. 
Follow [the instructions](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-native-app-auth/docs/usage/config) to set up your application. 

You can identify the configuration parameters based on the response received in **step 2**, when creating the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `issuer` corresponds to the endpoint of the **Authorization Service** `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}`
- `clientID` corresponds to `clientId`
- `redirectUrl` corresponds a value from `callbackUrls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 

You also need to set the `additionalParameters` property with the following values:
- `max_age: 0` This forces a new authentication flow once the user ends up on the **Authorization Service** frontend.
- `tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>` Optional, in case you are using a multi tenant setup. Set this to the actual tenant ID.

</MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

</MobileFrameworksCard.Content>

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="android">

<MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

You can use the [AppAuth-Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) library. 
Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android?tab=readme-ov-file#authorization-service-configuration) to set up your application. 

You can identify the configuration parameters based on the response received in **step 2**, when creating the **OAuth2 Client**.

For the `AuthorizationServiceConfiguration`, the parameters you need to provide are: `authorizeUrl` and `tokenFetchUrl`.
When calling the `AuthorizationRequest.Builder` function you can use `clientId` and a value from `callbackUrls` to replace the example values.

You need to set additional query parameters by calling the `setAdditionalParameters` function on the `AuthorizationRequest.Builder` object:
- `max_age: 0` This forces a new authentication flow once the user ends up on the **Authorization Service** frontend.
- `tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>` Optional, in case you are using a multi tenant setup. Set this to the actual tenant ID.

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="ios">

<MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

You can use the [AppAuth-iOS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) library. 
Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS?tab=readme-ov-file#auth-flow) to set up your application. 

You can identify the configuration parameters based on the response received in **step 2**, when creating the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `clientID` corresponds to `clientId`
- `redirectUrl` corresponds a value from `callbackUrls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 
- `authorizationEndpoint` corresponds to `authorizeUrl`
- `tokenEndpoint` corresponds to `tokenFetchUrl`

You also need to set extra query parameters, when instantiating the `OIDAuthorizationRequest` object, with the following values:
- `max_age: 0` This forces a new authentication flow once the user ends up on the **Authorization Service** frontend.
- `tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>` Optional, in case you are using a multi tenant setup. Set this to the actual tenant ID.

<MobileFrameworksCard.Content value="flutter"> 

<MobileFrameworksCard.Section>

You can use the [AppAuth](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_appauth) library. 
Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_appauth/tree/master/flutter_appauth) to set up your application. 

You can identify the configuration parameters based on the response received in **step 2**, when creating the **OAuth2 Client**.

- `<client_id>` corresponds to `clientId`
- `<issuer>` corresponds to the endpoint of the **Authorization Service** `^{appInfo.apiDomain}^{appInfo.apiBasePath}`
- `<redirect_url>` corresponds a value from `callbackUrls`
- `scopes` corresponds to `scopes` 

You also need to set the `additionalParameters` property with the following values:
- `max_age: 0` This forces a new authentication flow once the user ends up on the **Authorization Service** frontend.
- `tenant_id: <TENANT_ID>` Optional, in case you are using a multi tenant setup. Set this to the actual tenant ID.

:::info

If you want to use the [**OAuth2 Refresh Tokens**](/docs/authentication/unified-login/oauth2-basics#oauth2-refresh-token) make sure to include the `offline_access` scope during the initialization step.

### 5. Test the new authentication flow

With everything set up, you can test your login flow.
Use the setup created in the previous step to check if the authentication flow completes without any issues.
