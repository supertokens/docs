# Password managers 


## Overview 

Styling encapsulation relies on the ["shadow DOM" browser feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).
Password managers such as Dashlane, LastPass, or OnePassword do not detect authentication forms fields inside shadow DOMs.
Therefore, if you would like to make sure that your end users can use their password managers, you have to disable shadow DOM. 

:::info no-title
These instructions are only relevant if you are using the pre-built UI components.
:::

<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs exclude={["mobile"]}>
<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx preview="/img/emailpassword/password-manager.png" previewAlt="Demo of a password manager working with prebuilt UI when shadow DOM is not active"
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    useShadowDom: false,
    recipeList: [ /* ... */]
});
```

</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem>
<FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem value="angular">

```tsx preview="/img/emailpassword/password-manager.png" previewAlt="Demo of a password manager working with prebuilt UI when shadow DOM is not active"
// this goes in the auth route config of your frontend app (once the pre-built UI script has been loaded)
import {init as supertokensUIInit} from "supertokens-auth-react-script";
supertokensUIInit({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    useShadowDom: false,
    recipeList: [ /* ... */]
});
```

</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs.TabItem>
</FrontendPrebuiltUITabs>



:::caution
- SuperTokens uses a special attribute to define its styling. Disabling shadow DOM should not impact the rest of your application's styles. Verify that your CSS does not impact how SuperTokens UI appears when disabling Shadow DOM.
- Shadow DOM is always disabled with Internet Explorer since it does not support it. Similarly, if you intend to support Internet Explorer for your application make sure to verify how SuperTokens UI appears.
