# Password hashing

## Overview

**SuperTokens** supports two password hashing algorithms: `BCrypt` and `Argon2`.
Per current best practices, `Argon2` is the recommended algorithm. 
However, **SuperTokens** uses `BCrypt` by default since `Argon2` requires custom settings that are specific to the hardware in which the core is running on.

### Hashing time

The key metric to aim for when hashing passwords is the amount of time each hash would take.
By default, **SuperTokens** has configured these algorithms to take 300 milliseconds per hash on a machine with 1 GB of `RAM` and 2 virtual `CPU` cores.

## Change the hashing algorithm

You can switch algorithms whenever you want.
The change affects only the new users that sign up.
Previous passwords undergo decryption using the original algorithm.
For example, if you hash a password with `BCrypt`, it verifies using `BCrypt` even if the core configuration changes to `Argon2`.

Instructions:

<AccountTypeCard>

  <AccountTypeCard.ManagedContent>
      1. Go to the SuperTokens SaaS dashboard.
      2. Click "Edit Configuration" on the environment you want to change.
      3. Find the `password_hashing_alg` property and change it.
      4. Click "Save".

## Hashing calibration

This information is relevant only for self hosted core instances.
The managed service instances have already calibrated the algorithms based on the hardware.

:::important
When you change the hashing settings make sure to run the calibration CLI command to find the right balance for your hardware.

#### Algorithm settings

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `password_hashing_alg` | - | This setting chooses which password hashing algorithm to use. For using Argon2, set this to `ARGON2`. |
| `argon2_iterations` | `1` | This controls how much `CPU` processing power the hashing process uses. The higher the value, the more processing power, and hence the more time each hash takes. |
| `argon2_memory_kb` | `87795` (85 MB) | The amount of memory (`RAM`) that each hash takes. The higher this is, the harder it becomes to crack hashes offline, and the longer the algorithm takes. |
| `argon2_parallelism` | `2` | This is the number of threads the algorithm uses during hashing. The higher this is, the harder it would be to crack passwords offline using multiple cores. Should be equal to the number of virtual cores (or twice the number of physical cores) available in the system. |
| `argon2_hashing_pool_size` | `1` | This is the maximum number of concurrent hashes that the core performs. A value of `1` means that the core does only one hash at one point in time, other requests for hashing queue up and wait for their turn. |


##### Example

If each hash takes 300 milliseconds, a value of `1` here would entail ~ a max of 3 hashes per second (1000 ms / 300 ms). A value of `2` here would entail a max of 6 hashes per second (1000 ms / 300 ms)*2.

Password hashing occurs during sign in, sign up, and password reset flows. Therefore, you can set this value according to the target time per hash and how many sign ups/in you expect per second.

#### Calibrate to your hardware


To find the optimal setting for your hardware, you can run the `hashingCalibrate` command via the CLI. This command takes a few parameters:
- `--with_alg`:
    - The value of this should be `argon2`
    - Compulsory parameter
- `--with_time_per_hash_ms`:
    - This requires the target time per hash (in milliseconds).
    - The default value is `300`.
- `--with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`:
    - This affects how much memory the hashing process uses per hash.
    - The default value is `1`
- `--with_argon2_max_memory_mb`:
    - This is the maximum amount of memory (`RAM`) that the core should use for password hashing. The amount of memory per password hash is `with_argon2_max_memory_mb / with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`.
    - The default value is `1024`.
- `--with_argon2_parallelism`:
    - This is the number of threads that argon2 should use. The higher this is, the harder it becomes to crack passwords offline.
    - The default value is `2*number of cores`

Running the algorithm takes minutes.

The above produces an output like:

argon2_memory_kb: 357104 (348 MB)

argon2_parallelism: 4
argon2_hashing_pool_size: 1

====================
You should use these as docker environment variables or put them in the config.yaml file in the SuperTokens installation directory.
```

The contents of the `====Final values====` gives you the values of the parameters to provide to the core.

The algorithm starts with the highest amount of memory per hash (= `with_argon2_max_memory_mb/with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`) and `1` iteration.
It calculates the current average hashing time by simulating hashes concurrently (based on the value of `with_argon2_hashing_pool_size`). If the hashing time is greater than the target time, it reduces the memory by 5%. If it's less than the target time, it increases the number of iterations. The algorithm stops if the current time is within 10 milliseconds (higher or lower) of the target time.

:::info debug
If you see an output like:
```bash
/usr/bin/supertokens: line 9: 15 Killed "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}"jre/bin/java -classpath "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}cli/*" io.supertokens.cli.Main false "${ST_INSTALL_LOC}" $@
```
it means that the system doesn't have enough memory. Try to run the algorithm again with a lower memory value by passing `--with_argon2_max_memory_mb`

#### Calibrate to your hardware

To find the optimal setting for your hardware, you can run the `hashingCalibrate` command via the CLI. This command takes a few parameters:
- `--with_alg`:
    - The value of this should be `bcrypt`.
    - Compulsory parameter
- `--with_time_per_hash_ms`:
    - This requires the target time per hash (in milliseconds).
    - The default value is `300`

docker run registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-<db_name> supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=bcrypt
```
</SelfHostingTabs.Tab>

<SelfHostingTabs.Tab value="without-docker">

```bash
supertokens hashingCalibrate --with_alg=bcrypt
```

</SelfHostingTabs.Tab>
</SelfHostingTabs>

The above produces an output like:
```text
====Input Settings====
-> Target time per hash (--with_time_per_hash_ms): 300 MS


====Running algorithm====

Current log rounds: 11
..........Took 158 MS per hash

Incrementing log rounds and trying again...

Current log rounds: 12
..........Took 310 MS per hash

====Final values====
Average time per hash is: 310 MS

bcrypt_log_rounds: 12

====================
You should use this as a docker environment variable or put this in the config.yaml file in the SuperTokens installation directory.
```

The contents of the `====Final values====` gives you the values of the parameters to provide to the core.

The algorithm starts with the minimum recommended value (`11`), and increments it until the average time per hash is greater than the target time. The final value is then equal to the value that yields the closest time per hash as the target one.
