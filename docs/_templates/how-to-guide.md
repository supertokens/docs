# Title

> The following template is taken from [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/)
> Some adjustments/clarifications have been made in the context of the **SuperTokens** docs.

Let's first clear the different between a _how-to guide_ and a _tutorial_.
A _how-to guide_ is a step-by-step guide that helps a user accomplish a specific task (how to migrate users, how to configure sub domain login).
A _tutorial_ will get you from 0 to a fully functioning example (quickstart).
The easiest example here is a quickstart.
| To quote [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template/how-to):
| How-tos are task-oriented, while tutorials are learning-oriented
